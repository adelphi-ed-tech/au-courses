<article><p><strong>EDT 613 Teaching with social media</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> social media, social software, educational technology, social networks, online learning, informal learning</p>
         <p><strong>Description:</strong> Social media pervades our social life; with implications for education, business and beyond. Examine the sociological and psychological impacts, benefits and risks of social media. We examine social networking sites, (micro) blogs, video, and wikis; focusing on their use in classrooms to build community, develop literacy, and foster critical thinking.</p>
         <p>Social media has become an extremely successful and popular technology that has made its way into life of the individual as well as education, business and medicine.

Educators must have knowledge of this technology and understand it's sociological and psychological impacts, social benefits, privacy and security risks and potential applications for education.</p>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>You are expected to behave with the highest level of academic integrity.
