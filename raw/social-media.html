  <div id="syllabus-body"><p><strong>EDT 613 Teaching with social media</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> social media, social software, educational technology, social networks, online learning, informal learning</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Social media pervades our social life; with implications for education, business and beyond.

Since this technology has become an important part of society and because it can facilitate social interactions where people can connect and share thoughts, opinions, special interests and personal information, it has great potential for teaching and learning. Educators must have knowledge of this technology and understand it’s sociological and psychological impacts, social benefits, privacy and security risks and potential applications for education.</p>
