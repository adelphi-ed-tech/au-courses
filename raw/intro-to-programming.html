<h2>Quizzes</h2>
<p>There will be 10 pass/fail quizzes which will be completed individually at the start of class. Quizzes consist of 1-5 short answer programming questions drawn directly from the reading for the week. Quizzes are designed to be passed easily by students who are keeping up with the reading and the concepts in the course, and will help students and the instructor maintain a good pace for the development of the course.</p>
</section>
<section id="midterm" class="level2">
<h2>Midterm</h2>
<p>There will be an in-class midterm for this course on session 8. The midterm will require most/all of the available class time. The exam will consist of a short answer section as well as a full program which will likely require several functions to solve. There will be no partial credit for short answers. The full program will be scored with partial credit. Students will choose from one of two possible problems for the long-answer. The exam will be “open book”—students can use their notes, online resources, the course text, code examples from class, etc. The only exception is that real-time communication between students, or between students and outside parties is prohibited during the exam (i.e. no Slack, IM, texting, IRC, posting new questions to forums, etc).</p>
</section>
<section id="final-project-textual-analysis" class="level2">
<h2>Final Project: Textual Analysis</h2>
<p>For this project you will select a text or a collection of texts and write a program that uses computation to analyze the texts. It is up to you to both select the texts and to decide what type of analysis is “interesting.”</p>
<p>You should demonstrate the following in your code:</p>
<section id="marking-guide" class="level4">
<h4>Marking guide:</h4>
<p>There are a total of 20 possible points for this assignment, which will be evaluated on the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Question Quality</strong> (<em>3 points</em>)<br /> Does the question chosen reflect a problem that a computer program is good at analyzing? Is the question interesting or important? Is the answer obvious, or is it worthy of analysis?</p>
<ul>
<li>3 points: the <em>question can not be easily answered without the aid of software</em> because it analyzes a large data set, involves tedious/repetitive tasks which are prone to error, or requires complex calculations. Further, the <em>question is interesting</em>—it tells us something that is not already established in research or provides evidence for something that is incompletely or ambiguously understood</li>
<li>2 points: the question meets one of the two criteria for 3 points, but not both</li>
<li>1 point: the question is trivial or obvious after brief human analysis, or does not lend itself to generalization/abstract conclusions</li>
<li>0 points: the question would be more easily analyzed by human rather than computer analysis; trying to write software to answer the problem actually makes it more difficult to get a clear picture of the problem</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Coding fundamentals</strong> (<em>8 points</em>)<br /> The program demonstrates a grasp of the programming concepts covered in this class, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>variables</em>
<ul>
<li>data is not “hard coded” and can be easily changed by using variables</li>
<li>data is separate from functionality</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>functions</em>
<ul>
<li>abstraction through function parameters</li>
<li>encapsulation through function parameters and return statements; use “pure functions” with zero-side effects</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>design</em>
<ul>
<li>the program is organized through the use of functions</li>
<li>functions “scale” is appropriate to the task and discrete: concerns are separated logically, such as one function for gather results and another for displaying results</li>
<li>functions are written in a way that they are used several times in the program</li>
<li>code is not repeated</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>data structures</em>
<ul>
<li>use python built-in data structures appropriately: <code>list</code>, <code>dict</code>, <code>tuple</code>, <code>set</code></li>
<li>use index/slice notation if needed</li>
<li>sort data structures</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Point values:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>6-8 points: creates new functions that perform <em>new analysis</em> not available in the <code>content.py</code> program provided by the instructor. The program would easily be able to work on a different data set (i.e. different input text files) to provide good results. Functions are consistent (in that the parameters expected and results returned work well with other functions in the program) and can be combined in different ways.</li>
<li>3-5 points: code is clear and organized, but does not add significant new functions, some code may have unintended side effects, such as modifying list or dictionary data in unexpected ways; other code may take parameters, but not use them. Code cannot easily operate on other data sets.</li>
<li>0-2 points: repetitive tasks are not factored into functions, but exhibit more of a copy-paste approach, functions don’t (always) return the expected results or contain logic errors; code doesn’t run due to syntax errors or runtime errors</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk Taking</strong> (<em>4 points</em>)<br /> How “adventurous” is this code? Does the student show that they move beyond the template given to them? Is there evidence they read online docs or the course text to learn addition techniques to approach the problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>4 points: in several places, the program use advanced features such as optional functional parameters, list comprehensions, advanced sorting techniques, object oriented programming, or string formatting functions; libraries are imported to improve code performance and clarity; content.py functions are modified and improved by the student</li>
<li>3 points: some core changes are made to content.py, other advanced techniques are evident 1 or 2 times</li>
<li>1-2 points: tentative changes are made to content.py, mostly by adding composite functions that combine existing functionality</li>
<li>0 points: only cosmetic changes are made to the initial content.py example, such as changing the input text files and the target words passed into the <code>neighbors</code> function</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Style</strong> (<em>2 points</em>)<br /> Is the program consistently formatted according to Python conventions?</p>
<ul>
<li>2 points: consistently follows the spirit of the <em>Think Python</em> and PEP 8 style guides.</li>
<li>1 point: follows guide most of the time, shows internal consistency for style</li>
<li>0 points: lack of consistency in style makes the program harder to read and (potentially) harder to debug and maintain</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Results</strong> (<em>3 points</em>)<br /> The quality of your results include both the information that your program produces and the way that it is formatted for the user. When your program runs, it should produce some type of report that sheds light on your hypothesis. It doesn’t matter if your hypothesis was correct or not—after your program runs, the user should have more information to evaluate the hypothesis.</p>
<ul>
<li>3 points: results give clear support for or against the hypothesis by providing relevant information and are formatted in a way that makes them easy to interpret</li>
<li>2 points: results provide some evidence for or against the hypothesis. they may not be formatted in a way that makes them easy to interpret or they may leave some ambiguity that could have been explored further in the code</li>
<li>1 point: some evidence is provided but it is difficult to interpret either due to formatting or the output achieved</li>
<li>0 points: results do not shed any light on the question posed</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="deliverables" class="level4">
<h4>Deliverables:</h4>
<p>You should turn in all files related to your project in a single archive (e.g., .zip, .tar, .7z). Project files <em>must</em> contain your <strong>Python program</strong> and the data/text files you’re analyzing. The program must start with a comment where you identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>the question you are investigating (i.e. your hypothesis)</li>
<li>the method for investigating this question</li>
<li>the results identified by your code</li>
</ul>
<p>To create an archive file, Mac users can simply right-click the project folder from the finder and choose “Compress”. This will create a .zip archive of the project directory. Windows does not come with a compression utility by default. If you do not have one installed or are not sure, Adelphi IT recommends <a href="http://7-zip.org/">7-zip, which you can download and use for free.</a></p>
<p>Here is an example header comment:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># news.py</span>
<span class="co"># by: matt curinga</span>
<span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="co">Background:</span>
<span class="co">New York has 3 major daily newspapers:</span>
<span class="co">The New York Times, The Daily News, and The New York Post.</span>

<span class="co">It is commonly understood that the Times is written at</span>
<span class="co">higher level than the other dailies.</span>

<span class="co">Hypothesis:</span>
<span class="co">Computational analysis of articles will show that</span>
<span class="co">the Times is written at a higher level than the</span>
<span class="co">other two papers.</span>

<span class="co">Method:</span>
<span class="co">This program looks at four measures to compare</span>
<span class="co">the papers:</span>

<span class="co">1. Average sentence length</span>
<span class="co">2. Average word length</span>
<span class="co">3. Word diversity (unique words per 1k words)</span>
<span class="co">4. Average word frequency (computed against unique word frequency table)</span>

<span class="co">Results:</span>
<span class="co">The results of this program support the hypothesis in all</span>
<span class="co">four measures. The Times had longer sentences, longer</span>
<span class="co">words, greater word diversity, and lower frequency</span>
<span class="co">words.</span>
<span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

<section id="text-resources" class="level4">
<h4>Text Resources</h4>
<p>Here are a few links to places online where you can find full texts to download. This list is by no means exhaustive, but with these links you can certainly find a suitable text for your project. If you are looking for something more specific, or want to work with a text that is not in the public domain or released under a permissive copyright license, please contact the course instructor.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> (out of copyright books, other stuff)<br /> Project Gutenberg has a very large collection of texts, mostly classic works including novels, poetry, history, philosophy, etc. You can choose to download the texts as a text file (UTF-8 or ASCII). You probably want to delete the Project Gutenberg license and pre-amble stuff before you begin your analysis.</li>
<li><a href="http://libproxy.adelphi.edu:2048/login?url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?">Nexis-Lexis</a><br /> Lexis-Nexis is a database of newspaper (and other news) articles, which affords a range of search parameters. You can export the full text articles for more recent articles (published in the last 20 years or so). You will probably have to download your articles in batches and copy-past them into one file for your analysis. <em>You must log in to Adelphi follow this link</em>.</li>
<li><a href="http://libproxy.adelphi.edu:2048/login?url=http://www.jstor.org/cgi-bin/jstor/gensearch">JSTOR</a><br /> JSTOR allows you to search a range of academic journal articles. You cannot easily export the full text of the articles in one shot, but you can export the titles and abstracts, which is often enough for interesting analysis. Like Lexis-Nexis, <em>you must log in to Adelphi to follow the link</em>. <strong>Tips:</strong></li>
<li>use the basic search, which allows you to export abstracts and titles</li>
<li>change the options to show 100 results at a time</li>
<li>use the “select all” toggle to select the full page of results</li>
<li>choose “Printer-friendly” as the export format</li>
<li>copy-paste those results into one file</li>
<li>repeat for next batch of 100 results</li>
<li><a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/">Library of Congress</a><br /> The Library of Congress maintains a decent online collection of materials, including the text of historical documents and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page">WikiSource</a> WikiSource contains the full text of documents on Wikipedia and elsewhere there is a lot of overlap with Gutenberg, but it might be easier to find and access the WikiSource documents.</li>
<li><a href="http://americanrhetoric.com/speechbank.htm">American Rhetoric Speech Bank</a> I can’t vouch for this source in particular, but they do have a collection of famous speeches. Many/most of these are in the public domain, but this might be a decent place to look for them, if you want to analyze speeches.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sample-project-ideas" class="level4">
<h4>Sample project ideas</h4>
<p>One of the intentional challenges of this project is for students to generate their own ideas for projects. It’s one thing to answer a quiz question or to work on homework problems where you know exactly what you are supposed to do; quite another when you need to decide what the goals for the program are, too, and what results it should find.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas, though, that might get you started.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Compare the ways that U.S. news and foreign news cover a topic:
<ol type="a">
<li>choose your topic</li>
<li>download US news with a keyword search</li>
<li>download foreign news with same keywords</li>
<li>do a neighbor (n-gram) analysis of word counts near key terms</li>
</ol></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry">Stylometry</a><br /> Instead of considering the context and content of important keywords, stylometry would let us look at the style of a text. By considering common words and phrases, we might be able to answer questions such as:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>is a text written by a man or a woman?</li>
<li>do African Americans have a distinct writing style?</li>
<li>how has writing style changed over time? can we identify when a piece was written based on its style?</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Compare 2 books or 2 authors<br /> Create two texts from Gutenberg or another source and pick an area to analyze. Classic things to consider are the ways a text deals with issues of race, gender, sex, violence, humor, death, god/religion, etc.</li>
<li>Compare speeches:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>what are the difference and similarities between speeches from WWI, WWII, Vietnam, and today? Has the “security” message changed? Has the anti-war/peace message changed?</li>
<li>compare the speeches from different political parties? what propaganda do they use? how do they use language to shade the issues that are most crucial to their supporters?</li>
<li>what are the characteristics of a great speech? are the similarities between the rhetorical styles of Lincoln, Churchill, King, Malcom X and others?</li>
</ul>

    <h3>University Statement on Academic Assistance for Students with Disabilities</h3>
    <p>If you are a qualified student with a disability seeking accommodations under the Americans with Disability Act, you are required to self-identify with the Office of Disability Services, 3rd floor, University Center (516) 877-3145. Please see me at the soonest possible time for special arrangements, seating and other accommodations if necessary. At any point during the semester if you encounter difficulty with the course or feel you could be performing at a higher level, please feel free to see me.</p>

    <h3>University Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
    <p>You are expected to behave with the highest level of academic integrity. Cheating and other forms of dishonesty will not be tolerated and will result in the proper disciplinary action from the university. Classroom behavior that interferes with the instructor’s ability to conduct the class or ability of students to benefit from the instruction will not be tolerated. All beepers and cellular phones should be turned off while class is in session. You are expected to come to class prepared - this means having read and studied the assigned chapters before class. By having prepared in this manner, you will be able to maximize your time spent in class.</p>
    <p>Adelphi University demands the highest standards of academic integrity. Proper conduct during examinations, the proper attribution of sources in preparation of written work, and complete honesty in all academic endeavors is required. Submission of false data, falsification of grades or records, misconduct during examinations, and plagiarism are among the violations of academic integrity. Students who do not meet these standards are subject to dismissal from the University.</p>


    <h3>Use of Candidate Work</h3>
    <p>All teacher education programs in New York State undergo periodic reviews by accreditation agencies and the state education department. For these purposes samples of students’ work are made available to those professionals conducting the review. Student anonymity is assured under these circumstances.
