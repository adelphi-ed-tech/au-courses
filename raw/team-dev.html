<p><strong>Educational Technology EDT 802</strong></p>
<section id="description" class="level2">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The technology practicum focuses on the integrated, team-based development of educational technology. Student-teams partner with businesses, non-profits, schools, or universities to develop and deploy an educational technology solution. This course focuses on interdisciplinary, team approaches; students will fill two of the following roles during the course of the semester: instructional designer, technologist (coder/network admin), project manager, creative director.</p>
<p>This course is designed as a practicum for Masters students who are not enrolled in the New York State certification track and who choose not to take EDT 801 (the K-12 practicum). Students will gain real-world experience working as part of a multidiscplinary team developing interactive educational media. They will learn the tools and techniques of expert software development teams while building their professional portfolio.</p>
<p>The main goal of this course is for students to implement and extend their skills as part of a “professional” educational technology team. As a field-based course, they will work with real instructional designers, media producers, and software developers in the field.</p>
<p>Students will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>technical project management of interdisciplinary teams</li>
<li>software development methodologies, with a focus on lightweight/agile methodologies</li>
<li>client interaction</li>
<li>iterative software planning and development</li>
<li>rapid prototyping</li>
<li>usability testing and quality assurance</li>
<li>distributed/collaborative tools for virtual software and media development (things like git, trak, irc or whatever else the kids are using at the time)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Class sessions</h2>
<p><em>Most of the class sessions for the second half of the practicum will be organized like team project meetings. As a group, the team will review the current state of the project, and update goals and timelines. As needed, the meeting will be used for mini-lectures and workshops to meet the needs of the project, either presented by the students or the instructor.</em></p>
<p><em>The “topics” below are illustrative and will be altered to meet the needs of the project.</em></p>
<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Introduce students to the way the practicum works, the client site they will be working with, and the roles they will be performing.</p>

<h2>Assignments &amp; Grading</h2>
<p><strong>Weekly meetings (20%):</strong> Student progress will be evaluated by weekly meetings with the instructor, where they are asked to reflect on their progress so far. Each week, they will write a short journal entry, summarizing their success and setbacks in the project.</p>
<p><strong>Self-reflection (30%):</strong> At the end of the semester, each student will write a short reflective paper where they compare their stated goals for the project to the actual completed project.</p>
<p><strong>Field supervisor (50%):</strong> The liaison from the field/client site will complete an evaluation survey for each student, at the midpoint and end of the term.</p>

    <h3>University Statement on Academic Assistance for Students with Disabilities</h3>
    <p>If you are a qualified student with a disability seeking accommodations under the Americans with Disability Act, you are required to self-identify with the Office of Disability Services, 3rd floor, University Center (516) 877-3145. Please see me at the soonest possible time for special arrangements, seating and other accommodations if necessary. At any point during the semester if you encounter difficulty with the course or feel you could be performing at a higher level, please feel free to see me.</p>

    <h3>University Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
    <p>You are expected to behave with the highest level of academic integrity. Cheating and other forms of dishonesty will not be tolerated and will result in the proper disciplinary action from the university. Classroom behavior that interferes with the instructor’s ability to conduct the class or ability of students to benefit from the instruction will not be tolerated. All beepers and cellular phones should be turned off while class is in session. You are expected to come to class prepared - this means having read and studied the assigned chapters before class. By having prepared in this manner, you will be able to maximize your time spent in class.</p>
    <p>Adelphi University demands the highest standards of academic integrity. Proper conduct during examinations, the proper attribution of sources in preparation of written work, and complete honesty in all academic endeavors is required. Submission of false data, falsification of grades or records, misconduct during examinations, and plagiarism are among the violations of academic integrity. Students who do not meet these standards are subject to dismissal from the University.</p>


    <h3>Use of Candidate Work</h3>
    <p>All teacher education programs in New York State undergo periodic reviews by accreditation agencies and the state education department. For these purposes samples of students’ work are made available to those professionals conducting the review. Student anonymity is assured under these circumstances. If you do not wish to have your work made available for these purposes, please let the professor know before the start of the second class. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.</p>
