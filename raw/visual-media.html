<ol type="1">
<li>Understand major topics in philosophy of technology</li>
<li>Apply a philosophical lens to critique current and emerging technologies</li>
<li>Compare and contrast different philosophical traditions and synthesize them to make coherent arguments and assess the role of technology in society</li>
<li>Understand various positions (e.g. feminist, anti-technology, post-colonial) and why they are relevant to the development and use of educational technology</li>

<h3><a href="#educational-media-studio-50">Educational Media Studio (50%)</a></h3>
<p>Working from a visuality and media literacy perspective, students will develop a substantial educational media project with explicit instructional value. Students will choose their own audience for this work: both the target age and ability level, as well as the domain and content for instruction.</p>
<p>Regardless of the content, the work <em>must</em> pay explicit attention to the aesthetic and semantic content of the work, beyond the instructional value.</p>
<p>Acceptable media for this project include:</p>
<ul>
<li>original digital or analog games for learning</li>
<li>websites, web applications, or mobile (web) apps</li>
<li>interactive SMARTBoard lessons</li>
<li>original instructional video or audio (video can be animated, live action, screencasts, or a combination)</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with the educational media, each student will turn in a ~300 word reflection where they indicate the goals of their project in terms of visual culture and media literacy, and discuss their successes and difficulties in meeting these goals.</p>
<p>The media project will be evaluated in each of the following criteria, with a possible 10 points available for each area of evaluation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Aesthetics</em>: is the the work visually appealing? does it use visual metaphors and “visuality” to make it more powerful and appealing? does the author carefully use color and composition?</li>
<li><em>Learning sciences</em>: in what ways does the author draw on the best practices for how people learn and how people learn from visual media?</li>
<li><em>Curriculum</em>: how does the project meet the stated curricular goals? does it address an important learning goal for the target audience? does the scale of the media match the learning goals? i.e., does the media focus on the most important or most challening apsects to teach?</li>
<li><em>Technqique</em>: how well does the author demonstrate his/her facility with the given media? for example, do SMARTBoard lessons take advantage of the diverse tools available in the Notebook software? are digital images cropped and scaled “cleanly”? does the author demonstrate the ability to compose text and images?</li>
<li><em>Reflection</em>: does the reflective paper clearly state the goals for the project? does the author clearly articulate the reasons for the choices in the project?</li>

    <h3>University Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
    <p>You are expected to behave with the highest level of academic integrity.
