The _integrated thesis project_ of the Master's of Arts in Educational Technology
is the culminating experience of a student's time in the program, and displays
the range of new knowledge and abilities they have acquired during their studies.

All thesis projects:

- reflect a deep understanding of the research around educational technology
  and instructional design
- address a specific issue or problem of significance and importance to the student
- produce a "professional" level solution to the problem

There is no fixed format for the _project_ — we encourage creative and
innovative ideas. Frequently, thesis projects fall into one of these
broad categories:

- production of a mutlimedia or interactive educational artifact (e.g. a game, mobile app, website, data visualization, animation, or video)
- design of curriculum, teaching resources, or scholastic program integrating digital technologies
- a theoretical paper that forwards an original idea or concept related to educational technology
- an empirical study that tests a research hypothesis related to educational technology
- a research project that is part of ongoing research being conducted by one
  of the Educational Technology faculty or partners

Projects vary and should be designed in collaboration with the student's
advisor. The best projects focus on an area of intense interest to the student,
and serve to forward the students' professional goals; whether those goals are
to change careers, advance in their current profession, or continue studying
at the doctoral level.

Registering for the thesis project
------------------------------------
You can only register for the thesis course by submitting a proposal to your
advisor. You can work with any of the full time faculty in the Program in
Educational Technology. In certain circumstances, you can work with a thesis
advisor who is adjunct faculty or faculty in a different department.

Often, the best way to start a proposal is to send a few ideas to your advisor.
Think about:

- what technologies you wan to work with and learn more about
  (e.g. augmented reality, data visualization, interactive video)
- think about what domain or population you are interested in serving
  (e.g. science education, adult learners, early childhood, literacy)
- consider what you will produce at the end, and you will use it:
  - multimedia or software that is part of your portfolio
  - a new course or program that can be used in your school
  - a report or paper that is useful where you work
  - an scholarly article that can be submitted for professional or academic publications,
    or used as a writing sample for PhD programs

You can start writing down 3-5 different ideas, sharing them with friends and
mentors, and sending them to your faculty advisor. These ideas can start the
conversation around your thesis project and lead to the eventual proposal.

Once you have a proposal that descries the goals of the project, what will be
produced, and how it will be evaluated; you are ready to submit your proposal.
You do not register for this course through CLASS. Once you sign the proposal,
and it is approved, the course will be added to your registration.

Completing the thesis project
-----------------------------

The thesis project is completed individually. There are no class meetings or
regularly scheduled assignments. Your adviser will help you set goals, create
a timeline, and provide guidance and feedback as needed. The thesis is
**pass / fail** — you should present periodic drafts/prototypes to your adviser
to ensure that you are on track.
