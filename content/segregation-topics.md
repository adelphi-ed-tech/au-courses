Feb 17: NYC Schools Today                       video
=======================================================

New York City schools are diverse -- not in the meaning that Kozol derides where diverse means non-White or all Black and Latinx. Still, as we have seen, they struggle with integration. According to [the data at a glance from NYC DOE](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/about-us/reports/doe-data-at-a-glance), the population of >1.1M students are:

- 13.2 percent of students are English Language Learners
- 20.2 percent are students with disabilities
- 72.8 percent are economically disadvantaged
- Race or ethnicity:
  - 40.6 percent Hispanic
  - 25.5 percent black
  - 16.2 percent Asian
  - 15.1 percent white
- 119,551 are in charter schools

This week we will focus on the current state of schools.

This week's reading response forum will take the role of an "audio essay" where you upload an audio response to this week's readings. Like all of our reading responses, you should have a clear point, make interesting claims, and defend/explore them with evidence. To practice our technical audio production skills, you _must_ include at least 3 different audio clips from "Nice White Parents", and at least 2 other audio clips other than your voice. Your post must be between 7 and 10 minutes. If it's shorter, try to add some more depth. If it's too long, cut it until it's more focused. You should be able to upload your .mp3 or .wav file directly to this forum, you can you post a shared link to your google drive.

Schedule:

- read/listen Thurs (2/11) to Sat (2/13)
- upload your audio by end of day Sunday (2/14 💕)
- listen to all posts
- comment (in writing) on at least two different posts by end of day Monday (2/15)
