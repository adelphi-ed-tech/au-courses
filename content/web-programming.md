      Anyone who has lost track of time when
      using a computer knows the propensity
      to dream, the urge to make dreams come
      true and the tendency to miss
      lunch.<br>

**Description:** In this course students learn techniques of web programming to
develop interactive, educational media. Using the Javascript (React)
programming language and related web development technologies (HTML5, CSS, SVG)
for interactive front-end programming, and Python (Flask) for backend server
design, students gain practice in the programming and design of interactive
software.

**Key words:** computer science, web development, mobile web, interaction design,
html, html5, css, javascript, OOP, mobile first, React, python, Flask, REST

Course Communications
========================================================================

Participants in this course must actively participate in our suite of online
communications tools, including Slack (<https://auedtech.slack.com>),
Adelphi email, and the course website.

You _must_ check your Adelphi email and the `#code` channel on Slack regularly.
It is highly recommended that you install the Slack mobile client and an email
client on your mobile phone so that you receive "push notifications" of course
announcements. You _must_ install the Slack desktop client to facilitate sharing
code and screenshots from your development environment.

The best place to post general course questions and any content-related questions
is the `#code` Slack channel. The instructor as well as other students and
alums monitor this channel and often provide immediate support.

You are encouraged to contact the instructor at any time via email (<mcuringa@adelphi.edu>)
or direct message on Slack to `@mxc`.


Goals and Objectives
========================================================================

This course builds on CSC 602 to move beyond basic programming concepts;
students will gain expertise in building more complex computer programs, over
several iterations. At the end of the course, students will be able to design
educationally sound web-based learning media, solve moderately complex problems
using object oriented and functional programming paradigms, and collaborate on
team programming projects. This course focuses on the design of multi-tier,
networked software applications.

Specific teaching and learning goals include:

- designing web-based interactions and multimedia to support learning
- coding effective user interfaces for learning
- implementing Universal Design goals for accessible web sites
- identifying effective methods for teaching more advanced programming concepts
  and web design skills

Specific software development goals include:

- modeling real world problems with software
- iterative software development
- testing and debugging
- Object oriented programming concepts:
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  - Objects & Classes
  - Composition
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism

### Software Project Evaluation Rubric

_You will use this rubric to evaluate your work and progress in the class._

1. **React/Javascript**
   - poor: the code runs with errors, is incomplete, or a very close copy of the example project
   - satisfactory: code is organized into functions and uses parameters, code is well organized and well styled,
     can be improved by writing more general/reusable functions and parameters, being more flexible, or using
     Javascript idioms efficiently and correctly
   - excellent: code is well thought out and reusable functions create core parts of the site, functions are
     organized so that changes and new features can be easily implemented, code meets our style guides and
     clear/accurate names are given to all identifiers (variables, functions). It is clear that the program
     goes beyond the example project.
2. **Data modeling**
   - poor: most content is hard-coded in the Javascript code, model is an exact copy of example, and/or model
     does not support the goals of the site
   - satisfactory: data model supports the goals of the specific site, but may not be flexible enough for a
     different presentation or to handle new data
   - excellent: data model supports the site, and can support other uses without modification to the model, new content
     can be easily accommodated
3. **HTML**
   - poor: content is presented with little structure, or different HTML tags would better describe the content
   - satisfactory: there is a good fit between the tags used and the data they contain
   - excellent: there is a good fit between the tags used and the data they contain _and_ the code correctly
     and appropriately uses tags that were not part of the example code
4. **CSS**
   - poor: little or no styles, styles are defined that are not used or do not take effect because of errors
   - satisfactory: code demonstrates understanding of box-model, color, typography, and/or images
   - excellent: advanced layout are used to interesting effect (flex, grids, etc), code exceeds example projects
5. **User Experience**
   - poor: site is hard to read, understand, and use; labels and text are not well edited, items are not clearly organized,
     essential information is missing, and/or the design significantly impedes the usability of the site
   - satisfactory: site is easy to use and information is well organized, presentation is clear and clean
   - excellent: code, layout, and css combine to create an interesting effect, site has a high quality, professional feel
6. **Risk Taking**
   - poor: the project narrowly adapts worked examples and sample code; no evidence of attempts
     to incorporate ideas not strictly covered in class
   - satisfactory: the project attempts either a novel idea or to integrate sophisticated
     programming approaches beyond what is covered in class; it's evident that student
     is able to read technical documentation and adapt ideas for new purposes. some
     aspects of the program may not be fully functional or integrated with the rest of the program.
   - excellent: incorporates novel ideas and techniques, as in "satisfactory," but
     demonstrates a high level of success with the code and integration.
