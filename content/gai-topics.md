Assigned Groups
===============

These are will be your assigned groups for the semester. They will be important for several things, but most important is that you will complete a **group project** together for the multimedia learning presentation. You will work with your group to cover several chapters in _Multimedia Learning_ and to present it to the class. In addition to the multimedia learning presentation, the groups will be used for schedule when you present your topic report, although you will not be collaborating with you group for that report.

Group 1
--------
- Jennifer Southard
- Janine Quintino
- Brittany Willoughby
- Alyssa Haber

Group 2
--------
- Brynn Mclaughlin
- Samantha Romanello
- Tonianne Randazzo
- Lauren Umbrino

Group 3
--------
- Caileigh Berry
- John Lipponer
- Simon Swist
- Victoria Delucia

Group 4
-------
- Amanda King
- Robert Wilcox
- Nicole Spinelli
- Ashley Teich



Week 1
===============================================

### Read/Watch
- **Watch:** Welcome to the Generative AI Studio [Video]

### Read
- Chapter 2, "Science of Learning: Determining How Multimedia Learning Works" in _Multimedia Learning_. (below)
- Koetsier, J. (2022, November 8). [Generative AI: The Future Is AI Writing Its Own Code](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2022/11/08/generative-ai-the-future-is-ai-writing-its-own-code/). _Forbes_.
- Marche, S. (2022, December 6). The College Essay Is Dead. _The Atlantic._ (below)
- Roose, K. (2023, January 12). [Donâ€™t Ban ChatGPT in Schools. Teach With It.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html) _The New York Times_.
- Vincent, N. (2023, January 20). [ChatGPT Stole Your Work. So What Are You Going to Do?](https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-generative-artificial-intelligence-regulation/) _Wired_.

### Do
- Review the prior studio projects
- [Join the Ed Tech Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/auedtech/shared_invite/zt-1nglwox9s-m8Iwm8gYQmdH4W3hXFebFA)
   - install the app on your computer and your phone
   - joine the #generative-ai channel
- Create an account with [Chat-GPT](https://chat.openai.com/). Note that this is beta software. Somtimes it's slow. Sometimes it says it's too busy to log in or process your request.
- Post about a conversation with Chat-GPT about one of the concepts or ideas from the Mayer reading (_Multimedia Learning)_. Instructions below.

### Resources

After reading the chapter 2 in _Multimedia Learning_ have a conversation with Chat-GPT about one of the topics. See if it can help you understand it better, offer examples, give you citations, or (even) translate some text into a different language. Consider how much you _trust_ what it's telling you. Does it contradict the textbook at all? Take a screenshot of some (or all) of your chat and post it to the thread in our `#generative-ai` slack channel, along with a brief comment on what the experience was like.

**Post due by end of day Wed.**

Week 3
=============================================
Team Presentation on:
---------------------
- chapter  6: Coherence Principle
- chapter  7: Signaling Principle
- chapter  8: Redundancy Principle
- chapter  9: Spatial Contiguity Principle

**Team:** Jennifer Southard, Janine Quintino, Brittany Willoughby, Alyssa Haber
janinequintino@mail.adelphi.edu
jennifersouthard@mail.adelphi.edu
ALYSSAHABER@mail.adelphi.edu
brittanywilloughby@mail.adelphi.edu

**Presentation due date:** 2/9

### **Readings:**

- **group 1** reads all of the chapters above and creates a presentation for us
- **everyobyd** reads the introductory summary for those chapters and optionally reads the chapters
- **watch** the group presntation and post questions/comments on slack

### **Do**

- post the idea for your topic report in the forum below
- post in the multimedia examples forum


### **Resources:**

**Topic briefings**

From the syllabus:

> The "briefing" sessions will help us develop our domain knowledge of generative AI. You will choose a specific topic of your choice related to generative AI and then create a 3-minute briefing report -- a narrated slide show on your topic. We will watch your presentation in class and then have time for some follow up questions regarding your topic. In addition to your slideshow, you will also post the bibliography used to create your briefing. You should have at least 3 sources, one of them being an academic source. The specific topic of your briefing will probably relate to the aspect of generative AI that you will highlight in your multimedia project.

In this forum, please post your idea for your briefing. Here are a few ideas. You _can_ pick one of these, but they are provided to give you a sense of the scope:

- the technology behind image generation
- cheating and anti-cheating with Chat-GTP
- copyright and AI generated creative works
- learned bias in GPT-3
- solving (math/science/cs) problems with AI chat

Note that this _Q&A_ format doesn't show you other student posts until your own post. This will allow you to post your idea without having to account for what other people are doing. It's OK if you cover the same topic as another student. You _can_ change your mind, but you will probably be able to create a better briefing if you pick your topic now and start working on it.


**Multimedia Example**

For this activity, you will search the internet and find a multimedia resource that explains _something_ about Generative AI _or_ about multimedia learning. Either static multimedia (images, charts, diagrams, infographics) or dynamic multimedia (video, animation, interactive media) are fine.

Instructions for posting:

- give your post a new, relevant title
- post the media or link to the media
- briefly discuss how it incorporates or violates one of the multimedia principles for this week: Coherence Principle, Signaling Principle, Redundancy Principle, Spatial Contiguity Principle
