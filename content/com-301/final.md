A Spatial Story: Overview
=========================
For the final project in COM 301 you will create an
interactive spatial story. This interactive media
product will contain at least one interactive map
and supporting multimedia content that offers special
insight and exploration of your approved topic. The
final project will be a single page website
with embedded media and interactive elements.
Please see the [final project proposal](proposal.html)
for more information on topics.

Group Project?
--------------
Since multimedia products are typically developed in teams,
we encourage you to form a team of 3-4 people for your final
project. Working in a team, each member will be able to work
on specific multimedia elements, and also take ownership of
different aspects of the project (research, original art,
style code, software development, copy writing, project 
management, etc). You will be able to form your own teams,
as long as the team has at most 4 people. Your team
must work on a single project with an approved topic.

We understand that not everyone may want to work on a group
project. If your proposal is approved as a final project,
you will be able to work individually on your project, as
long as you are able to meet the requirements.

Design
------
Your project must present a clear, consistent design. Your
web page must follow a consistent style guide that considers
fonts, colors, layout (white space, padding), icons, and
images.

Multimedia Map
--------------
The core interactive element on your page will be
(at least one) interactive map. This map will provide
specific spatial analysis and context for your topic.

The map must have interactive elements such as markers
(e.g. points or shapes). The map must also
have a key or legend that explains the iconography,
colors, and other visual elements on the map.

The map should have additional design elements as needed,
such as custom icons, popups, layers, filters, etc.

Copy and Additional Media
-------------------------
During the semester we have explored several multimedia
projects that examine issues of spatial justice. Each
of them have been centered around maps, but also include
written narrative, data tables, information graphics,
photos, videos, audio, and other interactive media.

You final project should make use of these elements as
well. There is no strict requirement for the types
or quantity of which elements you need. If your map
is sufficiently developed and rich, may need only
a few titles and paragraphs of explanation, as well
as links for where your data comes from and an
explanation of your process.

In other cases, the map may be one of many media elements
where you include more writing and original media content.

Evaluation Criteria
-------------------
Your final project will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1. **Design**
   - Consistent style guide
   - Clear, usable, and accessible layout
   - Use of color, typography, and images
   - Use of icons and other visual elements
   - Incorporate high quality, professional media
     (e.g. no pixelated images, shaky video, fuzzy audio, watermarked content)
2. **Technology**
   - Write clean, valid HTML for a variety of devices and layouts
   - Use semantically clear names for all elements
   - Remove unused and unnecessary code and resources
   - Demonstrate a clear understanding of CSS
   - Build a web system that is easy to maintain and update
   - Integrate Javascript as needed for map, data, and other interactions
3. **Content**
    - Write clear, concise, and compelling copy
    - Design a narrative that engages a meaningful issue
    - Express a reasoned and critical view on your topic
    - Use data and research to support your narrative
    - Use media elements to support and enhance the narrative
4. **Risk & Originality**
    - Go beyond the minimum requirements and shared examples
    - Innovate in your design, your content, and/or your combination of materials
    - Take a chance on expressing a unique perspective that challenges readers/users
