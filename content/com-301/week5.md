Week 5: Case Study II: Political Representation
===============================================


<h2><i class="bi bi-book text-primary"></i> Seminar: Monday, Feb 19</h2>

**Goals:**

- Understand how interactive maps are designed to tell a story
- Deepen our understanding of gerrymandering
- Make sure that everyone has a working map project

### Readings due:
- Gerrymandering Project. [Redistricting Report Card](https://gerrymander.princeton.edu/redistricting-report-card/)
[interactive]
- PBSLearing. (2018) [The Battle for Votes: Gerrymandering](https://ny.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/the-battle-for-votes-gerrymandering-video/retro-report/)
[video][11:06]

### Agenda:
1. Designing spatial stories (30 minutes)
2. Gerrymandering and Spatial Justice (30 minutes)
3. Getting ready for next class (15 minutes)

### Homework: (due for Wednesday)
You **must** come to class with a working map project, using the new "points" system.
This is a follow up to our last lab. Before class you must:

1. Fork the [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/smoosh-glade-z6qnp5) 
   or [Replit](https://replit.com/@mcuringa/Adelphi-Brooklyn-Map) project.
2. Watch the [map points tutorial](map-markers.html) [23:41]
3. Update `points.js`
   - Add the points from your map
   - Delete the points from the example map (e.g. the Brooklyn Campus map)
4. Update `config.js` to recenter the map at one of your points
5. Change the HTML in `legend.html` and CSS in `styles.css` so 
   that the colors/labels reflect your data.
6. (Optional) Work on any of the challenges in the [markers lab](markers-lab.html)
   that seem interesting.

If you are having trouble with these steps, you should ask for help on Discord.
If you are working on this and getting frustrated, you should set up a tutoring
session at the CASE: [https://adelphi.edu/case](https://adelphi.edu/case)

**Do not wait until Tuesday night or Wednesday morning to start this work.**
