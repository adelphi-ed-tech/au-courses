Final Project Proposal
======================
Final projects can be a group or individual project,
but everyone must submit a proposal for a final project.
The proposal will outline your idea for the final project,
describing why it matters and what is at stake, who the
audience is, and what you hope to achieve. In addition,
you will describe key design and interaction elements,
and present a basic plan for how you will gather data
and conduct research to support your project.

Please follow this outline for your proposal:

1. **Introduction**
2. **Social & Spatial Justice**
   - What are the social justice issues?
   - What spatial justice aspects of it?
   - Why is it important?
   - What is at stake and who / what is affected?
3. **Audience**
   - Who is this for?
   - What do they already know about the topic?
   - What do you want them to know?
3. **Goals & Outcomes**
   - What do you hope to accomplish with this project?
   - How will you know if you accomplished your goals?
4. **Design**
   - Create a Pinterest board for your project with:
     - (at least) 3 pins for look/feel
     - (at least) 3 for related content or background information
     - (at least) 3 for interaction / map design ideas
   - Write a 1 or 2 paragraph narrative that describes the board
   - Write one paragraph that describes the space/geography of the map (where is it? what scale? local, regional, national, global?)
5. **Data & Research**
   - Where will you get your data?
   - What research will you do to support your project?
6. **Conclusion**

**Pinterest Narrative**

In this part of your proposal you will reference specific items on your 
Pinterest board and discuss why you chose them and how you might incorporate
them into your final project. The proposal should be 1-2 pages long, plus the
Pinterest board.

**Submitting the proposal**

Create your proposal as a Google Doc, Word Doc, PDF, etc and share it with
Professor Drew as a Direct Message on Discord. This document **must**
have a screenshot of your Pinterest board as well as a link to the board.

**Evaluation Criteria**

The proposal is worth 20% of your final grade. It will be evaluated
on how well you articulate each of the elements above. Generally,
you should create a document that addresses a meaningful issue related
to our course content and discussions. Your Pinterest board and narrative
should present a compelling vision for your interactive spatial story
that makes us believe that it is both worth doing and that you will
be able to accomplish it.
