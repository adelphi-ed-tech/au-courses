COM-301 Assignments
===================

1. **[Map Projects 1 & 2](map-projects.html)**\

   as well as reflect on your design choices.
2. **[Project Proposal](proposal.html)**\
   Everyone creates an individual proposal that "pitches" a final project as well
   as a visual Pinterest design board.
3. **[Final Project](final.html)**\
   The final project is a team (or individual) project where your group will
   create an interactive, multimedia website that features a map, other
   multimedia, and written analysis as a single web page.
