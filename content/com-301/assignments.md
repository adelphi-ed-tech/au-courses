COM-301 Assignments
===================

Map Analysis & Skills Project #1 (20%)
--------------------------------------

### Part 1: Mapping Points

In this assignment you will show your ability to plot “points” on an 
interactive map and to use HTML and CSS to create multimedia content 
at each point. You will also examine a map of your choosing in terms 
of data and storytelling. Your map will tell a story about the high 
school you graduated from and the surrounding area. Your map must have 
at least 4 points with an HTML pop-up. One of the points must be the 
location of your school, the other points might be other schools, 
locations of importance to you and your educational background, areas 
of community interest, historic sites, etc. There is no 
strict rule as to what you choose to include in your map.

#### Your HTML pop-ups must include the following:

- Use of HTML components and CSS to provide structure and layout of your page
- At least one static image (photo or illustration)
- At least one embedded video or audio file
- CSS to style the text on your pop-up
- Use of background colors, images, or gradients

#### To receive full points for this assignment you must:

- Demonstrate your ability to use relevant documentation by 
  including a technique that was not explicitly
  demonstrated in class or example
- Use the general skills of HTML and CSS development to 
  communicate your overall message
- Must be turned in on time ( before class on 2/12) by sending 
  a code sandbox link to your map code. The
  link should be posted to the #Project1 channel.


### Part 2: Map Analysis
For your map investigation, you will choose a map that represents data about a particular region.

#### Your Map Investigation (~200 words) must include:

- The map you chose (including a link)
- A summary and discussion of:
  - Who created it
  - What its purpose is
  - What data it includes and that data’s source
  - Speculation about what other kinds of data could help us 
    understand the issue the map is addressing
  - What story or version of the world it is advancing
- This summary should be sent as a DM to Professor Drew on Discord by 2/12 before class.


To submit assignment one, share your codesandbox as a public or unlisted project with Dr. Drew as a Direct Message on Discord.
Share your map investigation as a Google Doc with Dr. Drew.
