New Media Maps
==============
**The Department of Communications, 0108-301-001 Spring ‘24** 

Course Description and Purpose:
-------------------------------
The evolution of the internet and the devices that we use to access it have radically changed the way that people communicate, learn, and consume information in recent years. As the internet has expanded and become more ubiquitous in our lives, an explosion of new opportunities have emerged that can help us dynamically visualize and ultimately better understand our world. In this freshly conceived new course offering, we explore the rise of digitally-mediated maps and their capacity to expand the concept of spatial justice. While computing is relevant to a number of disciplines, students —especially marginalized students— may see computing as separate from their past experience, personal lives, and political commitments. In this course, we use new computer literacies to explore representations of place and space and will examine the questions such as:
 
- How do digital maps help us understand inequality?
- What stories do digital maps enable us to tell about places?
- What data can we collect about places?
- How can computational techniques be used to scrape, clean, analyze, and visualize this data? 
- Using digital technologies, what new maps can we create about places that are important to us? 
- As responsible computing artifacts, how do these maps support us in challenging inequitable organizations of space and envision alternatives?

Ultimately, this course will engage students in conversations using digitally-mediated maps, including information graphics and transportation maps, of Long Island, where campus is located. Doing so is expected to catalyze discussions about racism and inequality, as Long Island and New York City historically and currently experience high levels of school segregation, housing segregation, and debates about public transportation equality, all of which can be examined through digital map-making. In fact, a recent NPR podcast explicitly discussed school segregation in Garden City, where Adelphi is located, and neighboring school districts. The podcast draws on an interactive map project by EdBuild on segregated school districts, including many on Long Island. Exploring the map, how it was made, and what it means, will be an animating project in this course.

Course Learning Goals: 
----------------------
The overarching goal of this course is to inspire and provide each student with the skill-sets necessary to understand and exploit computational tools to notice, question, and imagine alternatives to the aforementioned inequalities and to engage students in responsible computing that situates computing in information literacy, art, our day-to-day lives, and sociopolitical issues. Through in-class computer literacy exercises, screenings, readings, discussions and assignments, it is expected that you will finish the semester with the ability to both analyze and produce and distribute a variety of data visualizations, including not limited to, digitally-mediated maps.

The specific objectives of the course are as follows:
 
- To develop a thorough understanding of contemporary digital map technologies and their relationship to economics, politics, spacial and social injustice, and you, the user;
- To develop a basic understanding of how code works and how data visualizations such as digitally-mediated maps are built;
- To introduce you to powerful design tools like Adobe Photoshop and Figma and survey how to utilize these tools in the service of map-making and other data visualization techniques;
- To establish working competency of how to output your self-produced media content in a web-browser based environment;
- To inspire you to become avid and passionate data visualization analysts and makers, and familiar with contemporary digital mapping tools and trends.

Course Prerequisites:
---------------------
A willingness to apply yourself on a weekly basis. The technical nature of the course makes it difficult to keep up if you miss class.

Students with Disabilities:
---------------------------

Honor Code Statement:
---------------------
Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or otherwise) for student assignments or exams.

_[THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS EXCERPTED FROM THE STUDENT HANDBOOK]_

Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the Adelphi University Honor Code. The purpose of the Honor Code is to protect the academic integrity of the University by encouraging consistent ethical behavior in assigned coursework by students. Following is excerpted from the Student Honor Code:
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying, cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited to, the following:

1. Fabricating data or citations
2. Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor
3. Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work
4. Sabotage of others' work, including library vandalism or manipulation
5. Plagiarism
6. The creation of unfair advantage
7. The facilitation of dishonesty
8. Tampering with or falsifying records
9. Cheating
10. Other forms of academic dishonesty


Turnitin:
---------
Adelphi University has a license agreement with Turnitin.com, a service that helps prevent plagiarism from Internet resources. I reserve the right to request an electronic copy of any written assignment submitted in this course for review through Turnitin.com. Please see Adelphi’s tips for students on preventing plagiarism and student instructions for Turnitin.com for more information.

Student Course Evaluations:
---------------------------
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Availability will end at the start of the final examination period. Your feedback is valuable and I encourage you to respond. Please be assured that your responses are anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after the end of the semester and therefore after course grades have been submitted.

Moodle: 
-------
The syllabus is posted on Moodle but we will not be using Moodle in this class, given its inferior status as a modern day communication platform. Instead, we will communicate via  email, Discord and our class website. For those unfamiliar with Discord, this is a widely popular communication platform that many media organizations and professionals now use to collaborate with colleagues. It can be downloaded to your phone and accessed in a web browser. There is also a desktop version of the app. Instructions about how to use the app will be given on the first day of class.  An invite to join the class Discord server will be emailed to you on the first day of class  1/24. If the University is closed for more than two days due to an emergency, please check your Adelphi email for an email from me with further instructions.

Course or Materials Fees: 
-------------------------
Laptops will be provided, or bring a laptop to class; you cannot complete this course on a phone. 


Assignments / Coursework:
-------------------------
The coursework that is required in this class includes 3 assignments and one final project.

Texts:
------
Required readings will be provided on a week by week basis via email. Please check your Adelphi email regularly for updates.


Grading / Evaluation:
---------------------
### Class Attendance + Participation (10%)
Because this is largely a technical course and much of what students learn materializes during in-class technical exercises, it is critical that you do your very best not to miss class and to arrive on time. If you need to miss a class, you are responsible for all of the material presented during that class meeting. Please arrange to get class notes and any other important information you may have missed from a peer. If possible, please email me ahead of time if you will be absent.  If this is not possible, please send me an email before the next class explaining your absence. Students with more than two unexcused absences will be penalized  5 points on their participation grade (per absence).

NOTE: The discussion of the project below is just to give you a sense of what they will look like. However, specific details may change as class goes on. Always consult the most recent version in Discord or as discussed in class before starting an assignment.

### Mapping Schools: Map Analysis & Skills Project #1 (20%)
#### Part 1: Mapping Points
In this assignment you will show your ability to plot “points” on an interactive map and to use HTML and CSS to create multimedia content at each point. You will also examine a map of your choosing in terms of data and storytelling. 

Your map will tell a story about the high school you graduated from. Your map must have at least 4 points with an HTML pop-up. One of the points must be the location of your school, the other points might be other schools, locations of importance to you and your educational background, areas of community interest, relevant, historic sites, etc. There is no strict rule as to what you choose to include in your map.

Your HTML pop-ups must include the following:

- Use of HTML components and CSS to provide structure and layout of your page
