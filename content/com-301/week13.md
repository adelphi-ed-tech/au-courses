Week 13: Layers
========================
This week shows us how to use **Python** and **Javascript**
to create multiple layers on a single map. Conceptually,
it works like this:

1. In python/colab:
   - load the data you need
   - get the data for a single layer (add a color column, etc.)
   - save the layer as a geojson file
   - download that layer to your computer
2 In javascript/repl.it
  - upload all of the geojson files
  - add each layer to the map
  - add layer controls to the map

Goals
-----
- Deepen understanding of managing data in Python
- Understand how to add multiple layers to a map
- Understand how to create custom titles and popups
  for data _features_
