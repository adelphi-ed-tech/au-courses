**App Inventor app instructions from syllabus**

> Working in a team, you will design, develop, and test a mobile app built with
> MIT's [app inventor software](https://appinventor.mit.edu/), which allows you
> to make mobile Android apps without writing any text-based code. We will all
> work on the same theme, which each team presenting their solution. The theme
> for the Hackathon will be determined by the class and the instructor. App Inventor
> apps only run on Android, but the software includes a simulator that any user
> can use from the web. The final product can be installed on an Android phone
> or tablet.

1. Form a team of 3 or 4 people.
2. You will have 2 weeks to co-design and build your app.
3. You can work collaboratively by screensharing in Zoom or sharing code by using the export/import feature of app inventor. You can use the [backbpack](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/other/backpack.html) to copy your partners' code into your version of the project.
