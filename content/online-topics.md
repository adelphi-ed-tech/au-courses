### Week 2: Instructional Design

<p style="background-color: #005691;color: white;padding:1em;border-radius:8px">
As Nilson and Goodson argue (in another chapter), good teaching is good
teaching, no matter the environment — there isn't a separate set of learning
theories that apply for online learning. In the required reading, Nilson and
Goodson provide a list of learning theories and research to guide instructional
design. Read this chapter closely and note the principles that you find
most important and/or surprising. If you plan on teaching higher education, you
might want to bookmark this book for later reference. Finally, the recommended
podcast episode highlights a discussion between Dr. Hung and Dr. Curinga from Ed Tech,
with Professor Bauler from TESOL/Bilingual, and Nafiza — an instructional
designer from Columbia University. The conversation offers tips for teachers who
are new to online instruction.
</p>


1. By **Friday**:
   - Read closely: Nilson and Goodson (2018) [Applying cognitive science to online teaching and learning   strategies](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/adelphi/reader.action?docID=5144407&ppg=99).
   - Respond to the discussion prompts on VoiceThread.

2. By **Monday**:
   - Respond to at least THREE of your peers on VoiceThread.
   - Complete Check your understanding 1.
   - Complete any of the optional readings that interest you.
   - Listen to the optional podcast.

### Week 3: Multimedia Theory

<p style="background-color: #005691;color: white;padding:1em;border-radius:8px">
Clark and Mayer present a series of design principles for multimedia—backed by
empirical research—that inform us how to create educational multimedia. These
principles are grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (discussed in Sweller, 2021).
Some of these principles may seem painfully obvious, but it's easy to forget
about them when you are creating educational material. Although you are all
reading the chapter "Applying the Multimedia Principle,"" and assigned a second
chapter to read, you should be familiar with all of these theories and principles.
</p>

**Read:**

- **Everybody reads:** Clark and Mayer (2016) [Applying the Multimedia Principle](https://moodle.adelphi.edu/mod/url/view.php?id=3380056)
- Read your assigned chapter (others optional):
  - [Applying the Contiguity Principle](https://moodle.adelphi.edu/mod/url/view.php?id=3380057)
  - [Applying the Modality Principle](https://moodle.adelphi.edu/mod/url/view.php?id=3380058)
  - [Applying the Redundancy Principle](https://moodle.adelphi.edu/mod/url/view.php?id=3380060)
  - [Applying the Coherence Principle](https://moodle.adelphi.edu/mod/url/view.php?id=3380059)
  - [Applying the Personalization and Embodiment Principles](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/adelphi/reader.action?docID=4418752&ppg=194)
  - [Applying the Segmenting and Pretraining Principles](https://moodle.adelphi.edu/mod/url/view.php?id=3380061)
  - [Human cognitive architecture: Why some instructional procedures work and others do not.](https://psycnet-apa-org.libproxy.adelphi.edu/record/2011-11701-011)

**Instructions for VT slide**

Each team will provide a concise summary of the chapter they covered. You do not
need to strongly coordinate or collaborate with your partner(s), but it might
be easier if you divide some of the work. On VoiceThread upload an audio or
video/multimedia summary of your assigned chapter where you focus our attention
on key theories, implications, examples, and open questions. Your team's posts
shouldn't exceed 10 minutes total (15 minutes for group 1 with 3 people).


_Forum: Cognitive Load Video and Multimedia Principles Analysis_

For this activity, we are all going to watch a brief video about "cognitive load
theory" from YouTube. After (or before) watching the video, create an account on
[timeline.ly](https://www.timeline.ly/). This is online tool makes it
easy to add comments for specific time-stamped sections of a YouTube video. For help
with Timelinely (or to give tips), please post on `#online-learning` on slack.

In your timelinely, you **must** comment on each of the multimedia principles:

1. Contiguity Principle
2. Modality Principle
3. Redundancy Principle
4. Coherence Principle
5. Personalization and Embodiment Principles
6. Segmenting and Pretraining Principles


More than six comments are welcome, but not needed. Consider commenting on:

- good use of a principle
- violation of one of the principles
- a (possible) exception to a principle
- a way that the video could be improved by adding multimedia according to a principle

### Week 4: Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
<p style="background-color: #005691;color: white;padding:1em;border-radius:8px">

This week we look at Universal Design for
Learning (UDL). The UDL guidelines
are important for any learning environment, not just an online course. In some
ways UDL is easier to apply online, provided you keep them in mind as you
design. Make sure you understand what the UDL guidelines are, since you'll need
to consider them when you design your own online unit. Don't feel you have to
apply all of them at once. As with Multimedia Theory, there are exceptions and
are not meant to be applied rigidly. A draft of your Narrated Tutorial
is also due this week. If it looks good, you won't have to revise it again.
<br>
There is no VoiceThread this week. Instead we will carry out our discussion
using Moodle forums, to give a different look and feeling for dicussion in an
online class.

</p>


**Read:**

- Novak and Thibodeau (2016) [The case for better online course design](https://moodle.adelphi.edu/mod/url/view.php?id=3380048)
- Novak and Thibodeau (2016) [Fewer barriers, more support: UDL guidelines in action](https://moodle.adelphi.edu/mod/url/view.php?id=3380041)

**To Do:**
- Carefully read the 2 chapters from Novak and Thibodeau
- Post your initial reading response on the UDL Discussion Forum forum by Sunday 2/19
- Post 2 thoughtful comments in the UDL forum by Tuesday 2/22
- Read and post final comments by Wednesday 2/23
- Post your narrated tutorial draft by Monday 2/20
- Post comments, recommendations, and suggestions on at least one Narrated Tutorial
  by Tuesday 2/22. To make sure everyone has feedback, you cannot post a second
  comment on a tutorial until each video has at least one comment.


**Due:** Narrated Tutorial Draft


UDL Discussion Forum
---------------------

This week we will carry out our class discussion using Moodle's standard
discussion forum. The "forum" has become one of the standard tools for online
learning and every platform ("Learning Management System") supports discussions.

The UDL reading includes examples for how to make a discussion forum compatible
with the goals of Universal Design for Learning. For this discussion, you will
have the option to submit your initial post as:

- text (~300 words)
- audio
- video
- google slides or PDF of a PowerPoint or other slide show
- a "mindmap" or semantic map diagram
  (you can use [coggle](https://coggle.it/) or another tool that you choose, post an image and/or link)

You can post your multimedia either as a file attachment or link. If you
upload audio, please post it as an mp3 as this is a very widely and easily
supported format.

There _is no prompt_ for your post. After carefully reading the chapters on UDL,
choose an idea from the readings that you want to discuss further and respond
to it in your post. A good post, typically, uses academic discourse and refers
to specific points in the reading. Don't summarize the ideas, but engage with them
by articulating why they are important, considering how they can be implemented,
why they _aren't_ important or conflict with other theories of learning, etc.
Your post (even though it's short), should have a _thesis_: express your own
idea and augment your idea with reference to the chapters, other readings,
and your own experiences.


**Listen to these instructions in audio format by playing the recording
listed under _Activities_ for this week.**



Narrated Tutorial Draft Forum
------------------------------
Create a short (3-5 minute) standalone, narrated video tutorial or mini-lecture
and upload it to YouTube. This video should be clearly narrated and thoughtfully
designed, following the principles of Multimedia Theory and using an appropriate
mix of multimedia (text, visual, audio, etc.) components. The topic is up to
you, but it should be educational and/or informative. You are encouraged to pick
one that you might use for your mini-unit or in a future lesson. The video can
easily be created using applications such as PowerPoint or Keynote, or a
screencast application like OBS, Screencastify, Quicktime Player or similar
application.

1. Look through the [Narrated Tutorial](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_uBTU8sz0FzBxywZyie5prZNFxpPQYIhgy2UdDEHE0/edit#gid=1396681982) rubric before you finalize your video.
2. Use stock images and clips from free sources such as
   [Morguefile](https://morguefile.com/), [Pexels]https://www.pexels.com/,
   [StockSnap](https://stocksnap.io/), or [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/),  
   or create your own images or videos. While you can use
   clips from other content, most of the video should be original. Do not use more
   than 15 seconds of another person's unedited video. If you need stock video
   footage, you can use Professor Hung's [Videoblocks](http://www.videoblocks.com/)
   account, using hung@adelphi.edu (login) and
   jgH}pHcnv{~2pM|$MS (password).
3. Give the video a meaningful title that isn't "Narrated Tutorial."
4. Upload your video to YouTube, if you publish it as "unlisted" it will
   not be listed in search or browse results, but anyone with the link can
   view it.
5. Post the link (not just the URL) to your tutorial in this forum. Give your forum post the same
   title as your video.

Post your video by Monday 2/20. Post comments, recommendations, and suggestions on at least one Narrated Tutorial
by Tuesday 2/22. To make sure everyone has feedback, you cannot post a second
comment on a tutorial until each video has at least one comment.

### Week 5: Platforms

**Due:** Pandemic Report Topic and Teams


Read through the potential [topic ideas posted last week](https://moodle.adelphi.edu/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=853768). Reach out to a potential teammate (email, slack, moodle) and form a partnership. If you are having a **very** hard time finding a partner, let me know and I will help make a match. Once you have a partner, make a new post in this forum where you:

1. Write a short abstract of your report where you state the main idea and how you will gather evidence (<200 words).
2. The names of 2 people on your team.
3. Comment on the posts as you see fit -- not required, but always welcome.


### Week 7: Presence

<div style="background-color: #005691;color: white;padding:1em;border-radius:8px">

<p>"Presence" refers to degree to which the online class feels like a coherent
and interactive learning community: "coherent" in that the activities should
feel like they belong together and are sequenced in a meaningful way;
"interactive" in that students shouldn't feel like their actions and responses
are going into a vacuum; "learning" in that students should feel they are
building knowledge; and "community" in that the class should feel a sense of
belonging. Students generally recognize presence as a good thing, but often find
it hard to design it into their online units so pay attention to the ideas
provided in the readings that boost social and cognitive presence.</p>

<p>
We will do this module as a split session, since we have <b>spring break</b>
next week. I recommend that you start with the two readings, and then
post in the forums <i>after</i> break. See the schedule below.
