**Goals for this project:**

- understand the ways that Javascript, HTML, and CSS work together
- use the React framework to combine HTML and JS
- understand how and when to use the `map()` function in JS
- use JSON resource files for data
- design a web applications that separates _content_ from _logic_ (code)
- create a useful website that presents a high quality user experience across devices

**Overview**

This first assignment is designed to get you up and running with
the key technologies we will use this semester. You will create
a data-driven web page as your own online resume or portfolio.

For this project, you will:

1. Keep all of the _data_ for your resume in .json data files. These files will
   contain the lists of your work experience, education background, technical
   skills, and other relevant information.
2. Code Javascript source files using the React framework and HTML5 to structure
   your web page. Use React component functions to create a program that is
   modular and easy to change. Your final project must have (at least) two
   different "looks" which can be swapped live. Your resume program must be
   separated into multiple source files (.js or .jsx) which are imported into
   `App.js` to compose the site.
3. Create or find any media assets (images, audio, video, etc) necessary for your
   resume. Your site _must_ contain some images.
4. Code CSS files to achieve your desired aesthetic and usability goals.

**To do:** (recommended sequence)

0. Review the instructions to make sure that you know the goals for this project.
1. [**Follow these instructions**](https://moodle.adelphi.edu/mod/page/view.php?id=3405499) to fork the project and get the demo/starter site running (ASAP).
2. Change the data, personal information, basic layout of the site so that it is _your_ resume.
3. Find some model resume / portfolio site online -- begin to incorporate ideas from
   those sites into your design.
4. Share your site in the Forum below, so that we can offer feedback.
5. Revise...
