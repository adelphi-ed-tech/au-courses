**Computer Science 0145-602 Section, Fall 2018**

**Keywords:**  computer programming, CS1, javascript, computational thinking, critical computational literacy, problem solving

**Description:** This course introduces students to programming and 
some core concepts of computer science, using a modern, object oriented
programming language. Students learn concepts of 
variables, functions, selection, repetition/loops, basic data structures 
(arrays, lists, hashtables), and basic object oriented programming.

> We are looking at a society increasingly dependent on machines, yet
> decreasingly capable of making or even using them effectively.<br>
> â€• Douglas Rushkoff, _Program or Be Programmed: Ten Commands for a Digital Age_

Assignments and Grading
=======================

Assignment              Pct   Due date
-------------------     ----  --------
Labs (10 total)         50%   Sep 13
Midterm exam            25%   Oct 18
Final project           25%   Dec 19


Labs (50%)
-------------------------

Most weeks there will be a programming lab due. Labs will consist of a single exercise
that focuses on using the computer programming concepts we're learning to solve
a problem. Each lab will be worth 0-5 points. Roughly:

- _0 points_: for not turning in any work
- _1-2 points_: for a basic attempt, but code isn't working or has fundamental flaws
- _4-5 points_ (mostly) solution demonstrates mastery of relevant concepts
- _5 points_: solution works, demonstrates mastery of concepts, and is well formatted and clearly written

Everyone's lowest grade will be thrown out (so your lab score will be the average of your 9 highest lab grades).

Midterm (25%)
--------------------------------

For the midterm, you will choose to write a program to solve 1 of 3 problems. Each problem will require demonstration
of all of the concepts covered so far in the course, as well as a demonstration of the computer
science problem solving approaches that we have been studying and practicing. The exam problems
will be similar to the lab exercises.

Computer program scoring guide:

- _5 points,_ **solution**: How well and correctly does the code solve the given problem?
- _5 points,_ **elegance**: Does the program make efficient use of programming concepts? 
  Are variables and functions used to create _abstractions_?
  Are the algorithms clear, straightforward, and concise?
- _5 points,_ **robustness**: Does the program handle different conditions/states? Would it be easy to adapt if the specification changed?
- _5 points,_ **style**: Is the code properly formatted? Do variable and function names follow our conventions? Is it written so that it can be easily read by a human?

Final project (25%)
-----------------------------

Students will work in teams of 2 or 3 to develop a final, group project. The project will be of the students
own design, but it will involve:

- accessing a data set (such as real-time data feed) 
- analyzing the data
- displaying results using text and graphical displays

The computer program scoring guide from the midterm will be used for the final project as well. All project members will receive the same grade.
