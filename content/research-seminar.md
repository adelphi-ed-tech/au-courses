**Educational Technology 0858-618, Spring 2012**

**Keywords:** research methods, good questions, design research,
ethnography, statistics, quantitative research, epistemology,
technology research, mixed methods, action research

**Description:** In this course, students investigate methods for
determining if a given technology contributes to a stronger
educational experience. Reviewing the body of research on
educational technology, students will probe the merits of different
methodologies. Students learn how to develop good research questions
and choose methodologies to conduct their own investigations.


## Goals
**Spring 2013 Seminar Topic: Girls & Programming**

This research seminar exposes students to the general methods of social
science research used in education settings as well as to the specific
research paradigms common to technology research. They need these skills
to be effective consumers of research; to make informed technology
choices and to stay abreast of current trends. Further, they will be
able to develop methodologically sound frameworks to test and evaluate
the effectiveness of their own technology initiatives in the field.

This course has two main goals:

1) to develop students' abilities to read and write about scholarly
   research in the area of educational technology, and
2) to foster their ability to conduct formal academic research and less
   formal evaluations of educational technology.

Students will be able to:

-   read common statistical terms and measures (e.g. ANOVA)
-   comprehend the major trends and questions in educational research,
    with a focus on technology
-   use data mining and business intelligent techniques to spot trends
    in data and implement continuous improvement
-   read and evaluate qualitative educational research
    -   ethnographic approaches
    -   interviews
    -   action research and design research
    -   conversation and discourse analysis
    -   mixed methods
-   implement online surveys
-   use digital tools for analyzing data (spreadsheets, SPSS, SQL
    databases)
-   use digital tools for visualizing and reporting numerical
    information
-   design measures to evaluate the success of technology initiatives

## Assignments and Grades
### Assignment 1 — Review of literature (40%)

This semester, we will collaboratively author a "review of
literature" related to gender studies of teaching computer science and related
engineerign topics.

Through this assignment, students will be evaluated on their ability to
understand, analyze, and synthesize research from a range of sources
using a variety of research methodologies.

Collaboratively we will create an outline and scope for the review.
Individual studentst will be responsible for sub-topics within the report.
The group will share responsibility for editing and revising the document.

**The final report will be completed by session 6.**

## Assignment 2 — Research design & Pilot (60%)

For the final assignment, each student will develop a novel research
study to explore an area of educational technology. Students will be
encouraged to develop research that they can implement in their current
work positions or in their upcoming fieldwork. The research design will
be evaluated on:

-   the importance of the research question
-   the clarity of the proposed study
-   the appropriateness of the methodology chosen
-   the feasibility of the study

**Due dates:**

- hypothesis & research question(s): session 7
- research proposal/protocol: session 10
- results: final session
