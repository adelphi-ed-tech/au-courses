Maker Lab 3: School Lab
=======================

<p class="lead">
<b>COM 301 New Media</b> has been redesigned for Spring 2024 in order to combine
creative digital design practices, with a greater focus on learning technical aspects
of computer science. We will study these practices through the lens of spatial
justice and critical cartography. During the semester, we will look at three cases
of social, cultural and political impact, and study both the issues around them
and how innovative digital design and digital maps can deepen our understanding.
