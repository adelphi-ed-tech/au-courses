<i class="bi bi-building"></i> Week 2: LEGO Robotics
====================================================
**In-person, Jan 30, 5pm-7pm**


<img src="img/brick.png" class="maker-img float-end d-none d-md-block" alt="imaginative sketch of early lego robot">

**Goals:** We will learn how to program the latest generation of LEGO robotics. We will
pick up key engineering and programming techniques, practice our design skills, and consider
other academic applications of robotics.

Background
----------
Papert's Constructionism research studied children learning the LOGO programming language.
To make the ideas of programming more concrete, Papert's team developed a physical turtle robot
that could be controlled through LOGO code. In the 1980s, this turtle evolved into the
"programmable brick" -- a computer built into a LEGO brick.
