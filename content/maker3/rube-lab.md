LEGO Robotics Catapult Lab
==========================

<img src="img/rube-wide.jpg" class="img-fluid d-block" alt="rube goldberg machine">

Overview
--------
"Rube Goldberg Machines" have been tried and true (maybe stale?)
hands-on projects in K-12 science classrooms; a way to teach
elements such as simple machines, design thinking, motion,
energy transfer, and more. In this lab, we will continue to
explore the potential of educational robotics by building
a Rube Goldberg machine with LEGO robotics mixed with other materials.
The focus of this lab is on creativity and originality. To constrain
the activity (and foster discussions between teams), each team
must build a system that ends by extinguishing a candle.

Time
----
90 minutes

Goals
-----
This lab is designed as a further exploration of
LEGO Robotics in the context of design, creativity,
play, and originality. Participants will:

- combine LEGO and non-LEGO materials to create a Rube Goldberg
  machine
- use at least 2 LEGO sensors and 2 LEGO motors
- program the large motor
- design a system that "works" but is also fun and novel
- implement an iterative design process
- each system must have at least 4 major components
- each team member must be the lead designer for at least one component

Prior activities
----------------
Before the lab, teams have been formed and members have been asked to review online
examples of rube goldberg machines. They have been asked to meet (online or in person)
to plan and sketch the major stages of their design. They must submit any specialized
materials they may need before the lab, and bring anything they need from home.

Stock Materials
---------------
- birthday candles, matches / lighters
- LEGO Spike Prime robotics kits (1 kit per team)
- extra LEGO people, bricks / gears / axles / etc.
- crafting:
  - marbles, dominoes, magnets, coins
  - string, rubber bands, tape, pipe cleaners, glue
  - glue guns
  - scissors, knives
  - cardboard, paper, felt, foam, plastic, wood
  - small cups, bowls, and containers
  - markers, paint, and other art supplies
- other electronics:
  - batteries, wires, switches, buzzers, LEDs
  - small motors, fans, and other moving parts
  - small microcontrollers (e.g., micro:bit, arduino)  
  - small speakers
  - breadboards, wires, resistors, capacitors, etc.


Procedure
---------
This is a largely unstructured activity. The teams will work to design a consistent
project that has a unified theme, and will sequence their components so
they work together and transition to one another. Each member will design
their own component, but teams are free to build them together, or just support
each other as they work on their own component. Teams **must document their work**
so they can include it in their portfolios.

Timeline:

- plan before the lab
- **meeting 1:** 90 minute build with instructor support
- independent work with access to maker lab (2 weeks)
- **meeting 2:** final build and show with 20 minute setup
