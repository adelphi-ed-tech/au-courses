Description
----------------------------------------------------------------
Students encounter the big ideas in Maker Education and STEAM as
well as the practices of the maker lab. Emphasis is placed on
engagement in and critique of the practice of “making” through
foundational literature and hands on studio culture with a focus on
learning and education. 

Goals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Students will explore and analyze foundational and contemporary theories and
   approaches of MakerEd and STEAM texts and respond through a series of written,
   audio and video prompts.
2. Students will engage conceptual, aesthetic, and practical aspects of MakerEd and
   STEAM through the generation and production of a series of material and digital 
   prototyping and final projects. This includes creative problem-solving, 
   collaboration and critical inquiry as they 'make' with others. Both processes and 
   final work will be included in student-created digital portfolios.
3. Students will analyze and evaluate the role of MakerEd and STEAM theories and 
   practices in educational settings through a final interactive online zine that 
   curates their learning across the course.value
4. Students will have fun and experience joy in learning, understanding and 
   demonstrating the role of play, risk-taking and experimentation in making and 
   creating in MakerEd and STEAM environments.

Class sessions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an intensive, summer course where we squeeze a full semester's worth of
work into two weeks! Weekday classes run from 4pm-7pm, and our two Saturday sessions
will run from 10am-4pm. In addition to class meetings, you will need to spend time
outside of class in the maker lab, and arrange time to complete your museum visits.

**Readings listed below are due for that class session, including our first meeting.**
Please come to class prepared to discuss the readings.

### Participation (10 pts)
A _class_ is a place where we study together. Your
participation will help make this a great class.

To get full participation points:

1. **Attend every class session.** This is a short course and there
   are no excused absences outside of medical exemptions with a doctor's
   note, modification from the Student Access Office, or
   a religious holiday.
2. **Don't be late. Don'te leave early.**
3. **Do the readings.** Come to class prepared to discuss the readings.
   If it's obvious that you didn't do the readings, or made little effort
   to engage with or try to understand them, you will lose participation points.
4. **Maintain the lab.** We are all responsible for maintaining the maker lab, closet,
   and our materials. Help us set up, help keep things clean and organized, help
   us put things away.
5. **Be bold.** This is a class about creativity and making. We want you to take risks,
   to try new things. _This is not an easy thing!_ 
6. **Be kind and respectful.** We love a spirited debate, strong opinions, and
   learning new things from each other. But those practices only work if we
   offer our respect to the other participants and assume they are operating
   in good faith, too.
7. **Communicate.** Read your emails. Post on Discord. Talk to your partners.
   Let the instructors know if there's a problem or question. Tell us how to
   make things better.

### Artist's Journal (10 pts)
Everyone will keep an artist's journal during this course
(and after, we hope). The Journal is a place for you to record
thoughts, plan designs, sketch ideas, and reflect. There will
be some "assigned" journal entries (see below), but mostly
it is meant for your own benefit. Journaling might not be for you...
but for the purpose of this course, try it out with an open mind.
