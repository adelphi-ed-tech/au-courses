Location: Room 7122 (7th floor maker lab)

Description
----------------------------------------------------------------
Students encounter the big ideas in Maker Education and STEAM as
well as the practices of the maker lab. Emphasis is placed on
engagement in and critique of the practice of “making” through
foundational literature and hands on studio culture with a focus on
learning and education. 

Goals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Students will explore and analyze foundational and contemporary theories and
   approaches of MakerEd and STEAM texts and respond through a series of written,
   audio and video prompts.
2. Students will engage conceptual, aesthetic, and practical aspects of MakerEd and
   STEAM through the generation and production of a series of material and digital 
   prototyping and final projects. This includes creative problem-solving, 
   collaboration and critical inquiry as they 'make' with others. Both processes and 
   final work will be included in student-created digital portfolios.
3. Students will analyze and evaluate the role of MakerEd and STEAM theories and 
   practices in educational settings through a final interactive online zine that 
   curates their learning across the course.value
4. Students will have fun and experience joy in learning, understanding and 
   demonstrating the role of play, risk-taking and experimentation in making and 
   creating in MakerEd and STEAM environments.

Class schedule
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an intensive, summer course where we squeeze a full semester's worth of
work into two weeks! Weekday classes run from 4pm-7pm, and our two Saturday sessions
will run from 10am-4pm. In addition to class meetings, you will need to spend time
outside of class in the maker lab, and arrange time to complete your museum visits.

**Readings listed below are due for that class session, including our first meeting.**
Please come to class prepared to discuss the readings.

### Participation (10 pts)
A _class_ is a place where we study together. Your
participation will help make this a great class.

To get full participation points:

1. **Attend every class session.** This is a short course and there
   are no excused absences outside of medical exemptions with a doctor's
   note, modification from the Student Access Office, or
   a religious holiday.
2. **Don't be late. Don't leave early.**
3. **Do the readings.** Come to class prepared to discuss the readings.
   If it's obvious that you didn't do the readings, or made little effort
   to engage with or try to understand them, you will lose participation points.
4. **Maintain the lab.** We are all responsible for maintaining the maker lab, closet,
   and our materials. Help us set up, help keep things clean and organized, help
   us put things away.
5. **Be bold.** This is a class about creativity and making. We want you to take risks,
   to try new things. _This is not an easy thing!_ 
6. **Be kind and respectful.** We love a spirited debate, strong opinions, and
   learning new things from each other. But those practices only work if we
   offer our respect to the other participants and assume they are operating
   in good faith, too.
7. **Communicate.** Read your emails. Post on Discord. Talk to your partners.
   Let the instructors know if there's a problem or question. Tell us how to
   make things better.

### Artist's Journal (10 pts)
Everyone will keep an artist's journal during this course
(and after, we hope). The Journal is a place for you to record
thoughts, plan designs, sketch ideas, and reflect. There will
be some "assigned" journal entries (see below), but mostly
it is meant for your own benefit. Journaling might not be for you...
but for the purpose of this course, try it out with an open mind.

To "grade" your journal, you will upload photos of key pages to 
your online portfolio and write a brief (~500 word) reflection 
about how you used it, and what you thought of the journal.

### Museum Visits (10 pts)
You will visit (at least) 3 museums outside of course hours. Each visit
must be at least one hour long. You must keep journal entries for each
visit that log the museum, the date and time of the visit, and key
exhibitions or works that you engaged with. You should also document
your visit with sketches, photos, and videos. You will create an
entry on your online portfolio for each visit. Your entries
should reflect on the visit in terms of course readings and discussions,
including considering how the museums work as public pedagogy, the learning
design, the aesthetic experience, politics of the museum, etc.

You _must_ visit at least one of the following "STEM" museums:

- [New York Hall of Science](https://nysci.org/)
- [MoMath: Museum of Mathematics](https://momath.org/)
- [Museum of the Moving Image](http://www.movingimage.us/)
- [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org/)

You can use your library card (New York, Brooklyn, or Queens) to get free
[culture pass](https://www.culturepass.nyc/) to many museums in the city.
Even if you can't take advantage during our short course, it is a great
resource.

The instructors will post other interesting museum exhibits and events
on Discord as well as invitations to join us for informal, optional fieldtrips
during the course. You can also check out the [NYC Arts Calendar](https://www.nyc-arts.org/)
for further ideas and events.

### Public Art Encounters (10 pts)
New York is full of public art: famous sculptures, big shows, 
street art, hidden and half forgotten works, and more. 
You will document at least 3 public art works that you 
encounter. At least one of these should be "sanctioned"
work and at least one should be "unsanctioned" work.

Document your encounter in your journal with at least
one sketch of each work, and notes on the context,
your experience, and thoughts on the work. Further
document your encounter with photos and videos.

Upload your documentation to your online portfolio.

### Maker Lesson (10 pts)
(TBD)

### Reading Responses (10 pts)
For each reading, you will write a "reading response" in
your journal prior to the class session (except for the first
meeting -- we will write them in class). Your response **must**
include a 150 word summary of the reading, it should also include
notes, questions, reference to key passages, and your thoughts.

Reading responses will be checked by the instructors at the
start of each class. For some sessions you will read your
response aloud or share with a partner.

### Maker Vest (15 pts)
We are all going to make a vest. Working from patterns provided,
you will design your own vest, cut the fabric, and sew it together.
You will design an embroidery or patch for your name, and also
a decorative design for the back of the vest. The vests will include
"wearable" technologies powered by Adafruit Qt Py microcontrollers.
Your technology integration can be playful, aesthetic, or functional.

In addition to the patch and tech, you will must also design and 3D
print an element for your vest. This could be a button, a zipper pull,
a buckle, or something else.

We will begin working on the vests during our first Saturday session,
but you will need to spend time outside of class to complete the project.

### Scratch Story Game (15 pts)
(TBD)

### Online Portfolio (10 pts)
You will create an online portfolio that will be used throughout
the Master's in STEAM Teaching and Learning. While the portfolio
will house many of your assignments, you are also responsible for
designing a site that reflects your identity as a maker and educator.

The portfolios will be created using Google Sites with your Adelphi
email account. You will be responsible for maintaining the site
permissions and making sure that it is available to the instructors
and other students in the class, and that some aspects (at least)
are fully public. Everyone is encouraged to use Google Sites, but
if you have a strong preference for another platform, you
can use it once you have instructor approval.

Your portfolio will be evaluated on how well you demonstrate your
ability to use the features of your online platform, you ability
to achieve a consistent and professional design and user experience,
the quality of your content (well edited writing, thoughtful images, clear audio, etc),
and the overall creativity and originality of your site.
