Description
----------------------------------------------------------------
Students encounter the big ideas in Maker Education and STEAM as
well as the practices of the maker lab. Emphasis is placed on
engagement in and critique of the practice of “making” through
foundational literature and hands on studio culture with a focus on
learning and education. 

Goals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Students will explore and analyze foundational and contemporary theories and
   approaches of MakerEd and STEAM texts and respond through a series of written,
   audio and video prompts.
2. Students will engage conceptual, aesthetic, and practical aspects of MakerEd and
   STEAM through the generation and production of a series of material and digital 
   prototyping and final projects. This includes creative problem-solving, 
   collaboration and critical inquiry as they 'make' with others. Both processes and 
   final work will be included in student-created digital portfolios.
3. Students will analyze and evaluate the role of MakerEd and STEAM theories and 
   practices in educational settings through a final interactive online zine that 
   curates their learning across the course.value
4. Students will have fun and experience joy in learning, understanding and 
   demonstrating the role of play, risk-taking and experimentation in making and 
   creating in MakerEd and STEAM environments.

Class sessions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an intensive, summer course where we squeeze a full semester's worth of
work into two weeks! Weekday classes run from 4pm-7pm, and our two Saturday sessions
will run from 10am-4pm. In addition to class meetings, you will need to spend time
outside of class in the maker lab, and arrange time to complete your museum visits.

**Readings listed below are due for that class session, including our first meeting.**
Please come to class prepared to discuss the readings.
