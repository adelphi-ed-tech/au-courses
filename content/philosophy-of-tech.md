## Description

The philosophy of technology exposes students to the major philosophical
movements through seminal works by Plato, Aristotle, Bacon, Kant,
Rousseau, Heidegger, McCluhan, Marx, Haraway, Latour, and others. These
critical positions will help students analyze educational technology
along pedagogical, social, political, and ethical lines.

Having a foundation in the philosophical roots of technology helps
orient students to the broader implications of the role that technology
plays in society. These philosophical traditions have continued to prove
their relevance today, where technology has the capability of improving
and constraining what we can do in our lives. The range of philosophical
positions that the course will expose students to will give them the
intellectual tools to approach and evaluate what technologies they want
to emphasize in their careers and how that might impact the lives of
others who will use the technology.

## Goals and Objectives

The course provides students with a broad historical perspective of the
philosophical positions on the role of technology in society. In
addition to understanding how technology is used, students should also
be aware of how it changes our relation to mind, perception, reality and
society.

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

1.  Understand major topics in philosophy of technology
2.  Apply a philosophical lens to critique current and emerging
    technologies
3.  Compare and contrast different philosophical traditions and
    synthesize them to make coherent arguments and assess the role of
    technology in society
4.  Understand various positions (e.g. feminist, anti-technology, post-colonial)
    and why they are relevant to the development and use of educational
    technology

### Final presentations and wrap-up

Students summarize key points in their final papers and class wraps-up
the topics covered in the course.

## Assignments & Grading

### Class discussions (20%)
Since this is a reading-heavy course, students are expected to
participate in class discussions, both as a large group and in smaller
groups. The instructor will use discussions to gauge students'
understanding of the material, and their ability to synthesize and
express ideas related to the philosophy of technology.

_The three papers are inter-related so students should have a general
idea of what their interests are with regards to the topic they want to
write about._

### [TED talk](http://www.ted.com) Emerging Technology (20%)
TED talk is a great resource to find out emerging technologies and
fringe ideas. Browse through their videos and pick one to focus on.
Write a short commentary on why the video appealed to you, what
possibilities it has for society and education, and where you think
it would go. (3-4 pages)

### Analysis of the impact of a technology on society (mid-term) (20%)
Use the topics covered in class to analyze a technology that has
made an impact on society (this can be any technology, it does not
need to be a _digital_ technology). Analyze this technology, using 
the perspectives of at least three readings from the class. (5-7 pages)

### Comparison of an emerging and existing technology (final paper) (40%)
Expand on the mid-term paper and contrast the technology chosen for
that paper with an emerging technology. The emerging technology
should not be older than ten years old, and the student would have
to define why he/she has defined the technology as emerging and how
it's related to the technology picked for the mid-term. For example,
if a student chose to analyze the telephone for the mid-term paper,
she will have to pick a technology that is related to the telephone,
either directly or tangentially. The student then has to draw from
any of the class readings from class and write a critical analysis
on how the technologies will shape society in the near future.
(15-17 pages)
