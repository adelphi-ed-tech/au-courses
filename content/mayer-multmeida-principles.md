6 Coherence Principle
=====================
**Coherence Principle:** People learn better when extraneous material is excluded rather than included. The coherence principle can be broken into three complementary versions: (1) learning is improved when interesting but irrelevant words and pictures are excluded from a multimedia presentation; (2) learning is improved when unneeded words and symbols are eliminated from a multimedia presentation; and (3) learning is improved when interesting but irrelevant music is excluded from a multimedia presentation. Each version of the coherence principle is addressed in turn in this chapter.

**Example:** A learner receives a concise, narrated animation on a desktop computer (concise group) or the same lesson along with interesting but irrelevant video clips or photos, interesting but irrelevant facts or stories, specific mathematical details, or background music, or in three-dimensional immersive virtual reality (expanded group).

**Theoretical Rationale:** Extraneous material competes for cognitive resources in working memory and can divert attention from the important material, can disrupt the process of organizing the material, and can prime the learner to integrate the material with an inappropriate theme.

**Empirical Rationale:** In 18 of 19 tests, learners who received concise multimedia presentations performed better on tests of transfer than did learners who received multimedia messages that contained extraneous material. The median effect size is d = 0.86. The median effect size is d = 1.27 for version 1 (remove seductive text and graphics), d = 0.70 for version 2 (remove additional details), and d = 0.95 for version 3 (remove background music).

**Boundary Conditions:** The coherence principle may be particularly important for learners with low working memory capacity or low domain knowledge, and when the extraneous material is particularly interesting.

7 Signaling Principle
=====================
**Signaling Principle:** People learn better when cues are added that highlight the organization of the essential material.

**Example:** In an example of verbal signaling of a narrated animation on how airplanes achieve lift, signaling involves adding an introductory sentence that named the three main sections (using the same words as in the lesson), a heading for each of three sections (using the same words as in the lesson), and vocal emphasis on key words. In an example of visual signaling of a narrated animation on neural transmission, an onscreen character points to the specific part of the graphic as she talks about it.

**Theoretical Rationale:** Verbal and visual signaling reduces extraneous processing by guiding the learner’s attention to the key elements in the lesson and guiding the learner’s building of connections among them.

**Empirical Rationale:** In 15 of 16 tests, learners who received verbal signaling performed better on transfer tests than did learners who did not receive verbal signals, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.69. When we focus just on multimedia lessons, learners who received verbal signals in multimedia lessons performed better on transfer test performance than learners who did not receive verbal signals in seven of eight tests, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.51. In 11 of 12 tests, learners who received visual signaling in a multimedia lesson performed better on transfer tests than did learners who did not receive visual signals, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.71. The combined effect size is d = 0.70.

**Boundary Conditions:** Verbal signaling was effective in the form of classic signaling (e.g., adding outlines, headings, and pointer words) and graphic organizers (e.g., spatially arranging the key terms into a structure such as a matrix) but not for highlighting (e.g., putting key printed words in red coloring or using more vocal emphasis for key spoken words). Visual signaling was effective in the form of specific pointing gestures (i.e., when an onscreen agent points to the specific part of the graphic they are talking about) but not general pointing gestures (i.e., when an onscreen agent points in the general direction of the graphic); and visual signaling is effective when visual and auditory signals are coordinated (e.g., when a part of graphic turns red at the same time that the narrator gives vocal emphasis to its spoken name) but not for color changes alone (e.g., when a part of the graphic turns red). Signaling may be particularly useful when the signals are used sparingly, when the learner has less skill or knowledge, and when the multimedia lesson is disorganized or contains a lot of extraneous material. 

8 Redundancy Principle
======================
**Redundancy Principle:** People do not learn better when printed text is added to graphics and narration. People learn better from graphics and narration than from graphics, narration, and printed text, when the lesson is fast paced.

**Example:** A learner views a narrated animation on lightning formation (non-redundant group) or a narrated animation along with concurrent onscreen captions that contain the same words as in the narration (redundant group).

**Theoretical Rationale:** Redundancy creates extraneous processing: (a) because the visual channel can become overloaded by having to visually scan between pictures and onscreen text, and (b) learners expend mental effort in trying to compare the incoming streams of printed and spoken text.

**Empirical Rationale:** In eight of 12 tests, learners who received graphics and narration performed better on tests of transfer than did learners who received graphics, narration, and printed text. The median effect size was d = 0.10. In five of five tests involving fast-paced narrated animation, learners who received animation and narration performed better on transfer tests than did learners who received animation, narration, and printed text. The median effect size was 0.72.

**Boundary Conditions:** Negative effects of redundancy may be reduced when (a) the captions are shortened to a few words and placed next to the part of the graphic they describe, (b) words are unfamiliar or in a second language, and (c) there are no graphics and the verbal segments are short. In each of these cases, extraneous processing is diminished.

9 Spatial Contiguity Principle
==============================
**Spatial Contiguity Principle:** People learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented near rather than far from each other on the page or screen.

**Example:** In an animation on lightning formation, captions are presented at the bottom of the screen (separated presentation) or are placed next to the event they describe in the animation (integrated presentation). In a booklet on lightning formation, the text is presented on a different page than the illustrations (separated presentation) or each paragraph is placed next to the illustration it describes (integrated presentation). In an onscreen illustration of a car’s braking system with each component numbered, the text is presented as a legend at the bottom of the figure (separated presentation) or is presented next to the component it describes (integrated presentation).

**Theoretical Rationale:** When corresponding words and pictures are near each other on the page or screen, learners do not have to use cognitive resources to visually search the page or screen and learners are more likely to be able to hold them both in working memory at the same time. When corresponding words and pictures are far from each other on the page or screen, learners have to use cognitive resources to visually search the page or screen and learners are less likely to be able to hold them both in working memory at the same time.

**Empirical Rationale:** In nine of nine tests, learners performed better on transfer tests when corresponding text and illustrations were placed near each other on the page (or when corresponding onscreen text and animation segments were placed near each other on the screen) than when they were placed far away from each other, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.82.
Boundary Conditions: The spatial contiguity principle is most applicable when (a) the material is complex, (b) the diagram is not fully understandable without words, and (c) the learner is not familiar with the material.


10 Temporal Contiguity Principle
================================
**Temporal Contiguity Principle:** People learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaneously rather than successively.

**Example:** First the learner views an animation on lightning formation and then hears the corresponding narration or vice versa (successive group) or the learner views an animation and hears the corresponding narration at the same time (simultaneous group).

**Theoretical Rationale:** When corresponding portions of narration and animation are presented at the same time, the learner is more likely to be able to hold mental representations of both in working memory at the same time, and thus, the learner is more likely to be able to build mental connections between verbal and visual representations. When corresponding portions of narration and animation are separated in time, the learner is less likely to be able to hold mental representations of both in working memory at the same time, and thus, less likely to be able to build mental connections between verbal and visual representations.

**Empirical Rationale:** In eight of eight tests, learners performed better on transfer tests when corresponding portions of animation and narration were presented simultaneously rather than successively. The median effect size is d = 1.31.

**Boundary Conditions:** The temporal contiguity principle may be less applicable when the successive lesson involves alternations between short segments rather than long continuous presentations, or when the lesson is under learner control rather than under system control.

11 Segmenting Principle
=======================
**Segmenting Principle: People learn better when a multimedia message is presented in user-paced segments rather than as a continuous unit.**

**Example:** For a narrated animation, a continuous version consists of a narrated animation on lightning formation that lasts about two and half minutes and describes 16 steps. A segmented version consists of the same lesson, broken into 16 segments – each containing one or two sentences and 8–10 seconds of corresponding animation – with a “CONTINUE” button in the lower right corner. The next segment begins as soon as the learner clicks on “CONTINUE.”

For a slideshow: a continuous version consists of 12 slides describing how to use a geographic information system (GIS) with many graphics and many short passages on each screen and the learner clicks on a button to move to the next slide. A segmented version consists of the same slideshow, but each click brings on progressively more material on each slide.

**Theoretical Rationale:** In viewing a fast-paced multimedia lesson that explains the steps in a process, some learners may not fully comprehend one step in the process before the next one is presented, and thus, they may not have time to see the causal relation between one step and the next.

**Empirical Rationale:** In seven of seven tests, people performed better on problem-solving transfer tests when a multimedia lesson was presented in bite-sized segments, each initiated by the learner, rather than as a continuous unit. The effect size was d = 0.67.

**Boundary Conditions:** The segmenting principle is most likely to apply when the material is complex and the presentation is fast-paced. Further research is needed to determine role of the learner’s prior knowledge. 

12 Pre-Training Principle
==========================
**_Pre-Training Principle:_ People learn more deeply from a multimedia message when they know the names and characteristics of the main concepts.**

**Example:** A no pre-training version consists of a multimedia lesson such as a narrated animation explaining how a car’s braking system works. A pre-training version consists of a multimedia lesson preceded by training on the names and characteristics of the key parts, such as a narrated animation on how a car’s braking system works preceded by training that shows the location of the piston in master cylinder, the brake tube, the wheel cylinders, and so on, as well as the states that each part can be in. A pre-training version of a game on electrical circuits involves providing a worksheet before the game that describes the rules for how batteries and resistors affect the flow of electrons.

**Theoretical Rationale:** In viewing a fast-paced narrated animation that explains the steps in a process, learners have to mentally construct a causal model of the system (i.e., a model of how the system works) as well as component models for each key part in the system (i.e., a model of the key states that each part can be in). Pre-training can help manage these two demands for essential processing by distributing some processing to a pre-training episode that occurs before the main lesson. Similarly, in playing a science game or simulation that involves relating the game action to relevant prior knowledge, pre-training can help provide or activate the relevant prior knowledge.

**Empirical Rationale:** In 10 of 10 tests, people performed better on problem-solving transfer tests when a multimedia lesson was preceded with pre-training in the names and characteristics of each key component. The median effect size was d = 0.78.

**Boundary Conditions:** The pre-training principle is most likely to be effective when the material is complex, the multimedia lesson is fast-paced, and the learner is unfamiliar with the material. 

13 Modality Principle
=====================
**Modality Principle: People learn more deeply from pictures and spoken words than from pictures and printed words.**

**Example:** An animation-with-narration version consists of a narrated animation on how lightning storms develop, whereas an animation-with-onscreen-text version consists of the same animation with the words from the narration printed on the bottom of the screen as a caption.

**Theoretical Rationale:** In the animation-with-onscreen-text version, both the pictures and words enter the cognitive system through the eyes causing an overload in the visual system. In the animation-with-narration version, the words are offloaded onto the verbal channel, thereby allowing the learner to more fully process the pictures in the visual channel.

**Empirical Rationale:** In 18 of 19 tests, people performed better on transfer tests when an animation or set of graphics was accompanied by narration rather than onscreen text. The median effect size was d = 1.00.

**Boundary Conditions:** The modality principle may be particularly applicable when the presentation is fast-paced, the learners are familiar with the words, the material is complex, and the tests focus on transfer. In contrast, printed words may be appropriate when the lesson includes technical words and symbols, when the learner is a non-native speaker, or when the lesson is learner-paced.

14 Personalization Principle
============================
**Personalization Principle: People learn better from multimedia presentations when words are in a conversational style rather than a formal style.**

**Example:** In a narrated animation on how the human lungs work, personalization involves using “you” and “your” in the narration script, such as “your nose” rather than “the nose” and “your throat” rather than “the throat.” In a simulation game, the onscreen agent provides advice and feedback using polite wording (e.g., “Do you want to click the ENTER button?” or “Let’s click the ENTER button”) rather than direct wording (e.g., “Click the ENTER button”).

**Theoretical Rationale:** When learners feel that the author is talking to them, they are more likely to see the author as a conversational partner and therefore try harder to make sense of what the author is saying.

**Empirical Rationale:** In 13 of 15 tests, learners who received the words of a multimedia lesson in a conversational style performed better on transfer tests than learners who received words in a formal style, yielding a median effect size of d = 1.00.

**Boundary Conditions:** The personalization principle may be most effective when the learners are beginners and the lessons are short. 

15 Voice Principle
==================
**Voice Principle:** People learn better from multimedia presentations when words are spoken in an appealing human voice.

**Example:** In a narrated animation on how lightning storms develop, students performed better on a subsequent transfer test if the voice was an appealing human voice rather than a machine-synthesized voice.

**Theoretical Rationale:** When learners feel that a human instructor is talking to them, they are more likely to see the instructor as a conversational partner and therefore try harder to make sense of what the author is saying.

**Empirical Rationale:** In six of seven tests, learners who received a multimedia lesson with an appealing human voice performed better on transfer tests than learners who received a machine-synthesized voice or an unappealing human voice, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.74.

**Boundary Conditions:** The voice principle may be most effective when there are no negative social cues (such as the image of a low-embodied agent on the screen).

16 Image Principle
==================
**Image Principle:** People do not learn better from multimedia presentations when a static image of the instructor is added to the screen.

**Example:** In a narrated slideshow on how the solar cells work, we can add a static image of the instructor standing next to each slide.

**Theoretical Rationale:** The static image of the instructor on the screen may be distracting and somewhat creepy because it does not display human-like movement, eye-gaze, and gesture. This can violate the coherence principle (in Chapter 6) and thereby create extraneous processing.

**Empirical Rationale:** Across four of seven experimental tests, learners who received a multimedia lesson with a static image of the instructor on the screen performed worse or only negligibly better on transfer tests than learners who did not see an image of the instructor, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.20 favoring adding a static image, which is in the small to negligible range.

**Boundary Conditions:** Having an image of the instructor on the screen may be effective when the onscreen instructor exhibits human-like movement, eye-gaze, and/or gesture (as explored in Chapter 17 on the embodiment principle) or when the agent explicitly points to relevant aspects of the material (as explored in Chapter 7 on the signaling principle). 

16 Image Principle
==================
**Image Principle:** People do not learn better from multimedia presentations when a static image of the instructor is added to the screen.

**Example:** In a narrated slideshow on how the solar cells work, we can add a static image of the instructor standing next to each slide.

**Theoretical Rationale:** The static image of the instructor on the screen may be distracting and somewhat creepy because it does not display human-like movement, eye-gaze, and gesture. This can violate the coherence principle (in Chapter 6) and thereby create extraneous processing.

**Empirical Rationale:** Across four of seven experimental tests, learners who received a multimedia lesson with a static image of the instructor on the screen performed worse or only negligibly better on transfer tests than learners who did not see an image of the instructor, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.20 favoring adding a static image, which is in the small to negligible range.

**Boundary Conditions:** Having an image of the instructor on the screen may be effective when the onscreen instructor exhibits human-like movement, eye-gaze, and/or gesture (as explored in Chapter 17 on the embodiment principle) or when the agent explicitly points to relevant aspects of the material (as explored in Chapter 7 on the signaling principle). 

17 Embodiment Principle
=======================

**Embodiment Principle:** People learn more deeply from multimedia presentations when an onscreen instructor displays high embodiment rather than low embodiment.

**Example:** In a narrated slideshow on how the solar cells work with a virtual instructor standing next to the slide, we can change from a static image of the onscreen virtual instructor on the screen (low embodiment) to an onscreen virtual instructor who exhibits human-like gestures, body movements, facial expression, and eye-gaze while explaining the slide (high embodiment).

**Theoretical Rationale:** A high-embodiment onscreen instructor can serve as a positive social cue that primes a sense of social partnership in the learner, causing the learner to try harder to understand the instructional message and thereby learn more deeply. In contrast, a low-embodiment onscreen instructor can be distracting, because an onscreen character who does not act like a human may be jarring or off-putting.

**Empirical Rationale:** Across 16 of 17 experimental tests, learners who received a high-embodied onscreen instructor performed better on a subsequent transfer test than those who received a low-embodied onscreen instructor, with a median effect size of d = 0.58.

**Boundary Conditions:** Having a high-embodiment instructor on the screen is most effective when there are no negative social cues to break the illusion of social partnership (such as a machine voice). Some forms of gesturing may be more effective than others, such as gestures that include specific pointing. Watching the instructor draw may be effective when the instructor’s hand or entire body is shown doing the drawing, but not when the drawing is dynamically created without any human hand or body shown. 

18 Immersion Principle
======================
**Immersion Principle:** People do not necessarily learn better in 3D immersive virtual reality than with a corresponding 2D desktop presentation.

**Example:** The desktop botany game, Design-a-Plant, can be converted into an immersive virtual reality game in which learners wear a head-mounted display and move through a virtual space.

**Theoretical Rationale:** The perceptual realism of immersive virtual reality may increase the learner’s emotional response and feeling of presence, which may motivate the learner. Alternatively, the perceptual detail of immersion virtual reality may create extraneous processing that distracts the learner from the core material in the lesson. This distractive feature of high-immersion media violates the coherence principle as described in Chapter 6.

**Empirical Rationale:** Across six of nine experimental tests, people who learned in immersive virtual reality performed worse on subsequent transfer tests than those who learned the same material on a desktop computer, yielding a median effect size of d = –0.10 favoring the desktop computer medium over the immersive virtual reality medium. Along with the image principle (described in Chapter 16), the immersion principle represents what does not work in multimedia instructional design.

**Boundary Conditions:** The negative effects of immersive virtual reality may be stronger for retention tests than transfer tests, and may be diminished as learners gain more experience with virtual environments.

19 Generative Activity Principle
================================
**Generative Activity Principle:** People learn better when they are guided in carrying out generative learning activities during learning (e.g., summarizing, mapping, drawing, imagining, self-testing, self-explaining, teaching, or enacting).

**Example:** After each of six sections in a virtual reality simulation on the human bloodstream, students are asked to verbally summarize what they have learned.

**Theoretical Rationale:** Engaging in generative learning activities causes the learner to engage in appropriate cognitive processing during learning, such as selecting important material, mentally organizing it into a coherent structure, and integrating it with relevant prior knowledge activated from long-term memory.

**Empirical Rationale:** In 37 of 44 experimental tests, across eight generative learning activities, people who were prompted to engage in generative learning activities performed better on subsequent transfer tests than students who were not, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.71.

**Boundary Conditions:** The positive effects of generative learning activities were strongest when the lesson included support or scaffolding in carrying out the activity and when the load imposed by the activity was minimized.
