**Game of the week: Zork I**

[Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) is a text-adventure / interactive fiction game
that was created in the late 1970s and then released for personal computers in 1980.
It builds on the even earlier adventure game, _Colossal Cave Adventure_. Both games
are pioneers in the new types of storytelling that games could make possible. In
today's terms it is part puzzle game, part interactive fiction. You can play Zork
on the web (for free) and there are plenty of hint/cheat sites if you feel the need.

- **Play here:** [Zork I https://textadventures.co.uk/games/play/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq](https://textadventures.co.uk/games/play/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq)
  - You can save your game by typing `save` and then load it with `restore`
  - Since it's running the browser, you will need to be in the same browser 
    (not private, without clearing cookies/cache) to load your saved game.
- Play Zork I for one hour
- Post your score and how far you got on Discord
- Play more if you want!


**Do**

1. Video and Readings
2. Play Zork
3. (Optional) Play a "modern" interactive fiction game
   ([like one of these](https://itch.io/games/made-with-twine))
4. Post once, comment twice in the Narrative Forum.

**Choose your game of the week:**

1. [Ace Attorney](https://www.ace-attorney.com/) [Win & Console]
2. [Undertale](https://undertale.com/) [Win, Mac, Linux, PS4, Switch] 
3. [Doki Doki Literature Club](https://ddlc.moe/) [Win, Mac, Linux]

These are more modern, story-driven games. Look at all three, and choose
the one that you want to play and learn more about. This week, I would
like you to play **the game for at least 2 hours**. One hour isn't
enough time to experience the unique elements. Of course, you are welcome
to play longer. _Doki Doki_ is free, the other two appear to be on sale
for around $10. I bought them on [STEAM](https://store.steampowered.com/).

**Do**

1. Start the game
2. Do the readings
3. Play more of the game
4. Post once, comment twice in the Design Forum. _Note: two prompts this week._

Costikiyan: I have no words
---------------------------

In your own words, explain what Greg Costikyan means by each of the following, in terms of game design:

- interaction
- struggle
- endogenous
- (any two elements of LeBlanc, as described by Costikyan)

Narrative Games
---------------
Referring to _Zork I_ and the game that you chose this week, write a game analysis essay
(~400-500 words) on one of the following themes:

1. Agency and player choice
2. Flow, challenge, and frustration
3. Character, story, and drama

Game Violence Debate Forum
---------------------------
The class has been divided into two teams. I have shared a Google Doc with the members of each team. You must contribute to your team's document, citing the readings for this week and making explicit references to games. Each team has an editor who will tell me when the document is ready to post. At that point, I will create two posts here, one for each position. You will read the other team's argument and comment to support your position and refute their arguments.





Thank you all for your thoughtful analyses of the narrative games we have been playing. Many of you did nice work brining in Fullerton's ideas of flow and conflict. Rose, gives us a good comparison of the "frustration curves" between **Zork** and **Ace Attorney**, showing how the "stable" curve of **Ace Attorney** makes the game more approachable and enjoyable. Kayleigh compares the frustration in **Zork** with the frustration in **Undertale**, finding **Undertale's** to be more productive and enjoyable. I think this is an accurate analysis, where **Undertale** uses it as an intentional game element while **Zork** is just _hard_. In part, **Zork** is an insider game developed by the hacker community (in the sense of academic and professional computer scientists if the 1970s) for itself. The Cyclops easter egg would almost certainly require looking at the code or knowing a developer to discover. In **Undertale** frustration -- the random fights that slow you down, the nagging feeling you missed something only to go back and realize you didn't -- is part of the game's story. It uses the game to convey the sense (_your_ sense) of being stuck. Annemarie reminds us, though, that the frustration in **Zork** can be a positive, in that it your actual accomplishments feel particularly satisfying and earned (as opposed to **Doki Doki** which allows you to float along with the story, at first).

Jamison, Divya, and Josh helped me think about **Zork** in new ways, as they describe the ways that the _world_, not the characters in it, provide the narrative structure. Even though **Zork** is seen mostly as interactive fiction and puzzle game, it really does invoke  later open world games. While your actions in **Zork** don't impact the later story the way they do in **Undertale** (which Josh highlights in his description of the **Undertale** genocide vs. pacifist runs), they still have real consequences for your ability to continue to explore the game and solve puzzles. In this way it's less linear than many later puzzle games.

These readings and other posts made me think more about the role of agency in games. As we've been reading, the ability for players to make meaningful choices and take consequential actions are core to good game design. Christopher's post on **Ace Attorney** highlights how story and character contribute to making those choices _meaningful_. Phoneix's actions aren't just meaningful because they alter the flow of the story and create new branches: they mean something because you care about the characters and what happens to them. Taye does a great job describing the narrative arc of **Doki Doki Literature Club**, an its impact on the game. Nicolette and Anna pick up this thread to investigate agency in DDLC, talking about how the _false sense of agency_, or lack of agency gives the game its power. This clever technique lends greater power and meaning to the central conflict in the game, while also offering a critique of the bland agency of meaningless choices found in the genre.

Honestly, it wasn't my intention to have a comparative discussion of narrative games. I offered the 3 games because I thought it would be more fun if youse all had a choice, to play a new game if you had played some of the others already, and to keep the expenses down with a free option. Reading your posts, though, I think that we were able to have a very rich discussion of the various aspects of narrative and character in games, and the ways that different games can capitalize on these elements.
