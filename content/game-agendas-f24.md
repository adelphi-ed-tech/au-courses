**Game of the week: Zork I**

[Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) is a text-adventure / interactive fiction game
that was created in the late 1970s and then released for personal computers in 1980.
It builds on the even earlier adventure game, _Colossal Cave Adventure_. Both games
are pioneers in the new types of storytelling that games could make possible. In
today's terms it is part puzzle game, part interactive fiction. You can play Zork
on the web (for free) and there are plenty of hint/cheat sites if you feel the need.

- **Play here:** [Zork I https://textadventures.co.uk/games/play/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq](https://textadventures.co.uk/games/play/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq)
  - You can save your game by typing `save` and then load it with `restore`
  - Since it's running the browser, you will need to be in the same browser 
    (not private, without clearing cookies/cache) to load your saved game.
- Play Zork I for one hour
- Post your score and how far you got on Discord
- Play more if you want!


**Do**

1. Video and Readings
2. Play Zork
3. (Optional) Play a "modern" interactive fiction game
   ([like one of these](https://itch.io/games/made-with-twine))
4. Post once, comment twice in the Narrative Forum.

Game Violence Debate Forum
---------------------------
The class has been divided into two teams. I have shared a Google Doc with the members of each team. You must contribute to your team's document, citing the readings for this week and making explicit references to games. Each team has an editor who will tell me when the document is ready to post. At that point, I will create two posts here, one for each position. You will read the other team's argument and comment to support your position and refute their arguments.





Thank you all for your thoughtful analyses of the narrative games we have been playing. Many of you did nice work brining in Fullerton's ideas of flow and conflict. Rose, gives us a good comparison of the "frustration curves" between **Zork** and **Ace Attorney**, showing how the "stable" curve of **Ace Attorney** makes the game more approachable and enjoyable. Kayleigh compares the frustration in **Zork** with the frustration in **Undertale**, finding **Undertale's** to be more productive and enjoyable. I think this is an accurate analysis, where **Undertale** uses it as an intentional game element while **Zork** is just _hard_. In part, **Zork** is an insider game developed by the hacker community (in the sense of academic and professional computer scientists if the 1970s) for itself. The Cyclops easter egg would almost certainly require looking at the code or knowing a developer to discover. In **Undertale** frustration -- the random fights that slow you down, the nagging feeling you missed something only to go back and realize you didn't -- is part of the game's story. It uses the game to convey the sense (_your_ sense) of being stuck. Annemarie reminds us, though, that the frustration in **Zork** can be a positive, in that it your actual accomplishments feel particularly satisfying and earned (as opposed to **Doki Doki** which allows you to float along with the story, at first).

Jamison, Divya, and Josh helped me think about **Zork** in new ways, as they describe the ways that the _world_, not the characters in it, provide the narrative structure. Even though **Zork** is seen mostly as interactive fiction and puzzle game, it really does invoke  later open world games. While your actions in **Zork** don't impact the later story the way they do in **Undertale** (which Josh highlights in his description of the **Undertale** genocide vs. pacifist runs), they still have real consequences for your ability to continue to explore the game and solve puzzles. In this way it's less linear than many later puzzle games.

These readings and other posts made me think more about the role of agency in games. As we've been reading, the ability for players to make meaningful choices and take consequential actions are core to good game design. Christopher's post on **Ace Attorney** highlights how story and character contribute to making those choices _meaningful_. Phoneix's actions aren't just meaningful because they alter the flow of the story and create new branches: they mean something because you care about the characters and what happens to them. Taye does a great job describing the narrative arc of **Doki Doki Literature Club**, an its impact on the game. Nicolette and Anna pick up this thread to investigate agency in DDLC, talking about how the _false sense of agency_, or lack of agency gives the game its power. This clever technique lends greater power and meaning to the central conflict in the game, while also offering a critique of the bland agency of meaningless choices found in the genre.

Honestly, it wasn't my intention to have a comparative discussion of narrative games. I offered the 3 games because I thought it would be more fun if youse all had a choice, to play a new game if you had played some of the others already, and to keep the expenses down with a free option. Reading your posts, though, I think that we were able to have a very rich discussion of the various aspects of narrative and character in games, and the ways that different games can capitalize on these elements.

### Goals

- think about how "entertainment" games can be used for educational purposes
- consider a specific example of games used in education
- reflect on the historical content of a game

### Game of the week: Civilization VI

[Civilization](https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vi/) is a highly regarded series of strategy games
that allow you to build and manage a civilization from the dawn of time to the near future. It supports individual play
and multiplayer (online). We are going to play it for 2 weeks, and it's the last game you will have to purchase this semester.

We are going to play Civ V. It's currently available for $30 on [STEAM](https://store.steampowered.com/app/8930/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_V/)
and [Humble](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sid-meiers-civilization-v). 
It's even available on the [Mac Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/civilization-v/id439924718?mt=12).

Play for at least one hour this week. If you want to arrange a game with other students, post on Discord.

3. Post in the Gaming History forum (details in forum).

Gaming History Forum
--------------------

**Please respond to both prompts. Post twice, comment twice.**

Model Bias
----------
Squire and Jenkins identify 4 "model biases" in Civilization (pp. 25-26). After playing Civ 5 this week,
do you agree that the biases they identify are still present? Add one more category of bias
that you believe is present in the game. Use specifics from the article and your gameplay to
justify your claim.

Red Dead Redemption II
----------------------
Olsson chose Red Dead Redemption II as the foundation for his college-level history course.
In what ways does Olsson's approach follow or diverge from the principles expressed
by Squire and Jenkins? Is Red Dead a good "ideological world"? Does Olsson's approach
take advantage of it?

### Goals

- learn about XR technologies and the types of games they support
- consider specific XR games for learning from a design and pedagogical perspective

### Game of the week: Civilization VI (or 5)

We are going to continue playing Civilization for another week. If you are an experienced Civ player,
maybe see if you can set up a time for multiplayer or to stream (or watch) some of the newer players.
While you're playing, think about how you might alter or mod the game to make it a better educational tool,
and consider if your changes would diminish the game playing experience.

**Post once, comment twice.**

This week we read about two different "mixed reality" games, _Savannah_ and _Coding Ocean_.
Analyze both games/interventions in terms of game design and learning design. What were the
designers' goals? How did the games "work" in terms of our studies of play?

Week 10: Designing as Learning

### Goals

- consider game design as an educational activitiy
- learn about the Scratch programming environment

### Game of the week: Scratch

Scratch is a block-based programming and design environment that makes it easy for
new programmers to write multimedia games and programs using a drag and drop interface.
It as become the first contact with computer science for many learners (along with LEGO robotics).
This week you will explore the types of games that kids (and adults) have made with Scratch.

Scratch Report
--------------
Go to the [Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and create an account. Play at least 3 games
that were created by the community. Write a mini game studies post of the game, here, including
screenshots. Also comment on who the author was (from what you can gather), if it is a remix of
another game, and what may have been _learned_ in the creation of the game. Find a game that
connects with the two readings this week, and discuss the readings in terms of the game.
