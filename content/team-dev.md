**Educational Technology EDT 802**

## Description
The technology practicum focuses on the integrated, team-based
development of educational technology. Student-teams partner with
businesses, non-profits, schools, or universities to develop and deploy
an educational technology solution. This course focuses on
interdisciplinary, team approaches; students will fill two of the
following roles during the course of the semester: instructional designer, 
technologist (coder/network admin), project manager,
creative director.

This course is designed as a practicum for Masters students who are not
enrolled in the New York State certification track and who choose not to
take EDT 801 (the K-12 practicum). Students will gain real-world
experience working as part of a multidiscplinary team developing interactive
educational media. They will learn the tools and techniques of expert
software development teams while building their professional portfolio.

The main goal of this course is for students to implement and extend
their skills as part of a "professional" educational technology team. As
a field-based course, they will work with real instructional designers, 
media producers, and software developers in the field.

Students will learn:

-   technical project management of interdisciplinary teams
-   software development methodologies, with a
    focus on lightweight/agile methodologies
-   client interaction
-   iterative software planning and development
-   rapid prototyping
-   usability testing and quality assurance
-   distributed/collaborative tools for virtual software and media
    development (things like git, trak, irc or whatever else the kids are using at the time)

## Class sessions

_Most of the class sessions for the second half of the practicum will be
organized like team project meetings. As a group, the team will review
the current state of the project, and update goals and timelines. As
needed, the meeting will be used for mini-lectures and workshops to meet
the needs of the project, either presented by the students or the instructor._

_The "topics" below are illustrative and will be altered to meet the needs of the project._

### Introduction

Introduce students to the way the practicum works, the client site they
will be working with, and the roles they will be performing.

### Agile software development

Readings due: Schwaber ch 1, 2

### Tools of team based development

### Milestones, sprints, time estimates

Readings due: Schwaber ch 4,6

### Wireframes & prototyping

### Testing & quality assurance

### Mid-point review

Students will review the progress so far, and reflect on feedback from
the client/supervisors. Everyone switches to a new role.

Readings due: Schwaber ch 7

### Usability testing

### Project meeting

### Project meeting

### Project meeting

### Project meeting

### Project meeting

### Deployment

### Conclusions

Students reflect on the project, and evaluate their performance as a
team, indicating what went well and what they would do different to
improve the project.


## Assignments & Grading

**Weekly meetings (20%):** Student progress will be evaluated by weekly
meetings with the instructor, where they are asked to reflect on their
progress so far. Each week, they will write a short journal entry,
summarizing their success and setbacks in the project.

**Self-reflection (30%):** At the end of the semester, each student will
write a short reflective paper where they compare their stated goals for
the project to the actual completed project.

**Field supervisor (50%):** The liaison from the field/client site will
complete an evaluation survey for each student, at the midpoint and end
of the term.
