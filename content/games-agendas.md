### Gaming autobiography
You will create a 5 minute presentation with the theme: _my gaming autobiography_. Your presentation will consist of 1 title slide with your name, title of presentation, and then exactly 5 content slides. Plan to spend exactly 30 seconds on each slide &mdash; set them to auto-advance.

Your presentation should focus on how games have been influential in your life. Please don't tell us every game you've ever played, rather consider key games (and other types of play) that have been meaningful to you in some way. You can include digital (video) games, as well as other games/play (including athletics). You might talk about the social experience of playing the games, how playing them affected you, negative or positive consequences of play, etc.
