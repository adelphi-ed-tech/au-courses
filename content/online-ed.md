Course Goals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Online, blended and web-enhanced learning is a major part of both higher
education and K-12 teaching, learning. Students need to become aware of this
new method of teaching, learning and instructional delivery. Students who wish
to become educational professionals need to understand the pedagogy, best
practices, interactivity and student-centered instructional design principles
required for quality online, blended and web-enhanced learning. Students
should also have an understanding of the political issues surrounding online,
blended and web-enhanced learning such as cost, technical infrastructure,
teacher development, student and teacher support and profit. By the end of the
course, students should be able to:

- understand the basic tenets, movement and use of online, blended and web-enhanced learning in K-12 and higher education;
- understand various technologies used for teaching and learning and course delivery in online, blended and web-enhanced environments;
- apply principles for the development of engaging and interactive online, blended and web-enhanced curriculum;
- design learning environments that address the challenges of creating interaction and community in online and virtual environments;
- apply best practices for teaching in online, blended and web-enhanced environments.

Assignments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Narrated Tutorial
Create a short (3-5 minute) standalone, narrated video tutorial or mini-lecture
and upload it to YouTube. This video should be clearly narrated and thoughtfully
designed, following the principles of Multimedia Theory and using an appropriate
mix of multimedia (text, visual, audio, etc.) components. The video should also
have subtitles (auto-generated captions don't count), which you can create in
YouTube. The topic is up to you, but it should be educational and/or
informative. You are encouraged to pick one that you might use for your
mini-unit (see below) or in a future lesson. The video can easily be created
using applications such as PowerPoint or Keynote, or a screencast application
like Screencastify, Quicktime Player or similar application. While you can use
clips from other content, most of the video should be original.

### Adaptive Quiz
Adaptive quizzes are quizzes that adjust its questions based on the answers
provided, and they can be a powerful way to do pre-assessments and mid-unit
checkpoints. For this assignment, design a quiz using Google Forms (or
comparable application) or the quiz function in a learning management system
(e.g., Moodle, Canvas) with a branching question structure that adapts to the
user's abilities. The quiz should be functional and meaningfully adaptive (i.e.,
the branching logic makes sense). Like the narrated tutorial, the topic is up to
you but it should work as an assessment tool. Avoid "personality tests" (e.g.,
the ones you see on Buzzfeed) that sort users into arbitrary categories. The
quiz should be able to sort test-takers into two distinct levels. It should also
be at least five questions deep; in other words, each test-taker should have to
answer at least five questions. In addition to submitting the quiz, please also
submit a map of the questions that shows all the questions and short rationale
on why you designed the adaptive quiz in the way you did. As a class, you will
be testing one another's adaptive quizzes to make sure they are properly
designed.

### Chatbot
Chatbots are automated bots with multiple uses, most commonly to answer
frequently asked questions. Using SnatchBot, design a simple, functional chatbot
that you can use in your class, mini-unit or workplace. Here's one I designed to
show you what it can do. Your chatbot should be able to handle at least three
questions that can be asked in any order. The interaction with the bot should be
reasonably coherent, so the conversation should not end abruptly. You can build
on what you did for your adaptive quiz or design a chatbot that does something
different. We will have time during the semester to play around with SnatchBot.
In addition to the chatbot, submit a short summary of how your chatbot can be
used. Include the Bot scheme that you can save from the application. As a class,
you will be testing each other's chatbot for functionality. Up to +15 Power Ups
for chatbots that can answer more questions, that use some of its more advanced
features (e.g., variables, operations), and particularly well-designed.
Throughout the semester, I will provide you with walkthroughs to help you get
started. The guides provided by Snatchbot are actually very good and easy to
follow. As you become familiar with the tool, you should play around with it
yourself and, if you get stuck and can't figure it out, you can let us know.
Start by asking your fellow peers for help first!

### MOOC
MOOCs stand for massive open online courses, which are online courses that you
can often take for free, often offered by reputable institutions and
organizations. For this assignment, audit a free course from edX on any topic
you want; I recommend the self-paced ones. You don't have to finish the course
but you should go through some of the activities. These courses are not as
intense as a credit-bearing course so if you spend at least 15-30 minutes per
week on this course, you should be fine. The purpose of this assignment is to:
1) give you direct experience with MOOCs prior to the readings and 2) give you
an idea of how online courses are organized (beyond this class). You will turn
in a short (3-4 page double-spaced) paper that briefly (~1 page) discusses what
you learned, then make connections to the readings and topics from this course
(~2-3 pages). Include a PDF of the Progression page on EdX to show how far you
got. It should show you completed at least two modules and passed at least one
of them. Note: It's free to audit these courses and that's all you need to do
for this assignment. You will lose access to the course six weeks later, though,
so keep an eye on the date and make sure you have all you need to complete this
assignment before you lose access. For example, if you forget to get the PDF
from the Progress page, then there's nothing we can do about it.

### Mini-Unit
The online mini-unit constitutes the biggest part of your grade and is split
into two phases: Prototype and Final Run. Together these will take up roughly
the last six weeks of the semester. During the Prototype phase, you will run a
rough and/or partial version of your mini-unit, and the rest of the class will
enroll as students. We will give you feedback that you will use to revise for
the Final Run, which will have to be polished. You will get feedback again that
you can use to revise it one more time. The mini-unit is a culmination of all
the readings and assignments you did in this class. It should be a
self-contained, complete unit that would take up roughly 3 hours of a student's
time. This means you shouldn't have students watch a 3-hour long video or read a
novel, as it would take up too much time; nor should it be too short. If your
unit is intended for a younger audience, let us know and we can adjust our
expectations. The mini-unit can be about something you might teach in class or
it could be something fun that works well as an online unit. The unit should
contain assessment(s) that checks for understanding. It should also contain some
logical progression, so it shouldn’t be just a single lesson or tutorial.
Finally, it should be designed for a minimum of 15 students. You won't have that
many enrolled in this class but it should be designed to accommodate at least 15
students.

#### Prototype

For the three weeks starting April 6, one third of you will teach a prototype of
your mini-unit while the read of us enroll as students. The prototype can be a
rough version of the unit or just a partial number of lessons. It should be
enough for us to evaluate whether it is headed in the right direction and
whether it adequately reflects your understanding of the topics covered in the
class. At the very least it should have activities to do and it should be built
on a platform of your choice. As the unit designer, you will be in charge of
running the unit as the instructor. If you are not presenting that week, then
you should enroll in two of your peers' units that week; this should give
everyone plenty of feedback. Don't use Edmodo: Although some of you may be
familiar with Edmodo, the way it is designed makes it difficult to differentiate
between different classes. Here's one done on Weebly that is quite well
designed. Students have also used Moodle, Canvas, and Schoology in the past.

Your Prototype will be evaluated based on whether the part you presented was
functional and ready; whether you had sufficient interaction with your students;
and whether it demonstrated an understanding of design principles we discussed,
especially Multimedia Theory and Universal Design. If you are a student, your
participation will be evaluated by the unit designer; this grade will go towards
your participation grade that week. Participating as a student means getting
involved in the activities, not just looking at the website.

#### Final Run

After your Prototype has run, go through the comments you received and list 3-5
of the main, recurring themes that you want to address. As the unit designer,
you can choose to accept or reject any comments, provided you give a rationale.
This should be turned in as part of your Final Run. (Approximate length: 1-2
pages double-spaced).

The Final Run will occur three weeks after you present your Prototype. That
means if you presented your Prototype first, you will do the Final Run first as
well. The upside of that is you will have a lot more time to polish it before
you turn it in. It should be a fully functional mini-unit. Everything - the
activities, the discussions, the assessments - should work. Your evaluation will
be based on whether the mini-unit as a whole was cohesive, had a logical
progression in topics, had meaningful assessments that let students know how
they are doing, was thoughtfully designed and straightforward to navigate. After
your unit has run, collect the feedback again and do any additional revisions
you want. You will turn in the mini-unit at the end of the semester. As with the
Final Run, it should come with a short (1-2 pages double-spaced) description of
what feedback you used or rejected. It should also point me to any changes you
made since the Final Run.

### Participation

This is a graduate course where you are expected to complete weekly readings and
fully participate in discussions in class and on Moodle. In order for the
discussion to flow smoothly online, you should respond to the forum discussion
by the dates noted on the syllabus, and spend the remainder of the week
responding to what your peers have posted. Your responses to your peers should
be thoughtful, critical and substantive. Your participation grade will be based
on the timeliness and quality of your posts, your responses to your peers, and
any other activities that might be associated with the week. Your participation
grade is given out on a weekly basis. You can track your participation grade
through your Progress Report. Late or missed points cannot be made up, although
you can earn points through Power Ups. Any participation posted two days after
the deadline cannot be made up. Participation points can only be made up through
doing bonus assignments through Power Ups.

### Power Ups

Power Ups give you a chance to earn extra credit points. Specific ways that you
can earn (and lose!) points are described in the Progress Report. Power Ups are
translated into levels. The higher the level, the more Power Ups you will need
to level up (like in a video game). You can get as much as five extra points
added to your final grade if you reach Level Five. Power Ups are given at the
instructor's discretion.
