Downey, A. B. (2016). [_Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Version 2.4.0_](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html). Green Tea Press.

Required Software & Hardware
============================
For this course we will be programming in the [Python](https://python.org) programming language, using a program/platform called [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

Class meetings
==============

This is a fully asynchronous online class, which will run on a Wednesday-Wednesday schedule,
meaning new topics will begin each Wednesday, and quizzes will be due by end
of day on Tuesday. There are no set meeting times, and there will not be
Zoom or other video class sessions. You will be able to flexibly schedule your
time within the week for each topic.

### Live labs

In addition to the required weekly assignments, there will be several "live"
labs on Wednesdays (4:30-5:30). These live **sessions are optional**,  but will
offer additional help and hands-on demonstration of course concepts. These sessions
will be hybrid/flexible (online/in-person) sessions held at the Manhattan Center.


Assignments and Grading
=======================

Assignment          Pct
-------------       ----
Quizzes             60%
Final Project       40%

Lab Exercises
-------------
Most weeks there will be ungraded lab exercises where students can practice
the new materials covered. In general, you should spend about one hour working
on these exercises. If you understand the exercises, you will be on track with
the course. There may be bonus problems that are a little bit more
challenging, which are optional. You are encouraged to work on the exercises
with other students and friends.

Quizzes
-------
Quizzes will consist of 1-3 questions, similar to the lab exercises. Each quiz
is worth a total of 6 points. Earlier in the semester, the quizzes will have
up to 6 questions each, with multiple choice and short answer questions. After
we develop more skills writing code, quizzes will consist of a single question
and you will copy-paste your solution or upload your source code to Moodle.

Quizzes will be timed, taken through Moodle. You will have 45 minutes once you
begin the quiz to submit your answers. Before you attempt the quiz, make sure
that you are ready to proceed -- you will not be able to pause the quiz once it
begins. You can use the textbook, course examples, and any documentation or
internet resources you find. **You may not ask other people for help.** While
programming is a highly collaborative practice, these quizzes are meant to
assess _your_ work and understanding.

Final Project: Content Analysis
-------------------------------

During the course of the semester we will be learning about the software design
process, and have the opportunity to write a larger program. The final project
is a group project, and you should work in a group of 2-4 students.

Content Analysis is a research approach that uses statistical methods to analyze
qualitative data. The skills we develop in our first semester of programming
will be enough to allow us to conduct our own, novel content analysis research.

We will be focusing on the analysis of textual data, with examples looking at
the content found in works of literature and in political speeches.


### Deliverables:

1. **Code Files and Resources**\
   You should turn in all files related to your project in a single
   archive (e.g., .zip, .tar, .7z). Project files _must_ contain your
   **Python program** in the Jupyter Notebook which runs the main loop
   of your program and produces the output (tables, graphs, text) which
   "answers" your research question.

   In addition to the source code and output, you should include any data
   files, media, or supporting source code your project requires.

2. **Group Video Demo**\
   Your group should provide a narrated screencast or video of 3-4 minutes that demonstrates
   your program running and explains in greater detail the goals of the program
   and the results it produces.

 3. **Individual Video Walkthrough**\
    Each group member will create their own video (uploaded to their Moodle account only).
    This video walkthrough of the code should highlight your specific contributions to the project,
    focusing on key aspects of the code where you were the sole or lead author.
    In particular, your video should highlight your understanding of the key
    concept of _abstraction_ in computer programming, and how you used it to design
    your program. See the more specific _coding fundamentals_ below for ideas
    of what to highlight in your video. Videos should be ~5 minutes in length.



### Final Project Grading:
1. **Concept & Design** (_5 points_)\
   Does the project demonstrate a good match between the type of question
   you explore and the type of answers that computer analysis can provide?

2. **Coding fundamentals** (_20 points_)\
   The program demonstrates a grasp of the programming concepts covered
   in this class, including:

    - _variables_
        - data is not "hard coded" and can be easily changed
        by using variables, soliciting user input, and/or reading from files
        - data is separate from functionality
    - _functions_
        - abstraction through function parameters
        - encapsulation through function parameters and return statements;
          use "pure functions" with zero-side effects when possible
        - composition and re-use of code
    - _design_
        - the program is organized through the use of functions
        - functions' "scale" is appropriate to the task and discrete:
          concerns are separated logically, such as one function
          for gathering results and another for outputting results
        - functions are written in a way that they are used
          several times in the program
        - code is not repeated
    - _data structures_
        - use python built-in data structures appropriately:
          `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`, etc
        - use index/slice notation if needed
        - sort data structures
        - map, filter data as needed
    - _style_
        - is the code style consistent throughout the program?
        - does the code adhere to the style conventions discussed in our readings?
        - are variables and functions named in a clear way?
        - are comments and docstrings included to clarify the program?
    - _testing_
        - does the program include test functions to ensure the program is working as expected?

    Each team member will receive an individual grade for this portion of the project.

3. **Risk Taking** (_5 points_)\
   How "adventurous" is this project? Does the team show that they move beyond the
   template given to them? Do they come up with a really novel and desirable project?
   "Riskier" project push beyond the material strictly covered in class and demonstrate
   the teams' ability to learn new things and push their horizons.

4. **Results** (_10 points_)\
   How well does the program achieve its goals? Are the results clearly
   presented in the Notebook file?
