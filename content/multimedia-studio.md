**Description:** How can digital media best support learning?
Working on semester-long projects, students learn about interaction
and instructional design. In this hands-on studio, develop and
extend skills in multimedia authoring: digital images/audio/video,
and interactive web development. Apply these skills to create a
original educational resources.

**Class meetings:**

On the schedule, live video call meetings will be held via Zoom, 4:30pm to 6:30pm.
As the health situation evolves, we may hold some hybrid flex sessions on these
days, where I will be in-person in the Manhattan campus and invite anyone to
join in person. If you cannot make it in person, we will all join via Zoom.

Asynchronous sessions will have no set Zoom meeting or other time. Activities for
those weeks will be coordinated through the Moodle class site.

Each semester the multimedia studio features a different challenge, dealing with an
important, global topic. Students will be asked to work on a semester
long multimedia project that teaches some aspect of this challenge.

The Spring 2021 Studio theme is **school segregation**, with an initial focus on
the New York City public schools. Racially segregated schools may initially
appear to be a thing of the (recent) past, but the issue persists as a
recalcitrant, multifaceted problem in our contemporary society -- both as an
impediment to educational equity and excellence, and an obstacle to social
equality and justice.

## Goals
This course is designed to challenge students to develop their abilities
as instructional designers and as authors and producers of digital media
for learning. Specifically, they should learn to:

-   design an effective digital learning environment that is intuitive
    to use and follows principles of Universal Design for Learning
-   develop in-depth skill in one area of digital production: video
    editing, graphic design, game design, computer programming, web
    design, etc.
-   understand key concepts of instructional design, including meeting
    the needs of the target audience, assessing learning outcomes,
    and following sound and ethical pedagogical principles
-   think creatively about far-reaching challenges in teaching and
    learning

At the end of the studio, every student will have a high quality, published
multimedia artifact that will be part of their portfolio.

critique                  20%
final project             30%

### Participation

Everyone is expected to participate fully in class. This means meeting deadlines
for online posts and, coming to class sessions prepared by having read the
readings. During "studio" work sessions, you will be expected to post an update
of your progress with screenshots. Each student will receive written feedback
on their participation at the end of week 7.

### Topic briefing

The "briefing" session will help us develop our domain knowledge of school
segregation. You will choose a specific topic of your choice related to
segregation and then create a 3-minute briefing report -- a narrated slide show
on your topic. We will watch your presentation in class and then have time for
some follow up questions regarding your topic. In addition to your slideshow,
you will also post the bibliography used to create your briefing. You should
have at least 3 sources, one of them being an academic source. The specific
topic of your briefing will probably relate to the aspect of school segregation
that you will highlight in your multimedia project.

### Multimedia on multimedia

Working with a partner (or group of 3), you will create a multimedia slideshow
that demonstrates the key multimedia cognition concepts covered in 2 chapters of
_Cognitive Load Theory_ (Plass et al., 2010) or _E-Learning and the Science of
Instruction_ (Clark & Mayer, 2016). The books are available online from the
Adelphi Library. The total presentation must be between 10-15 minutes long. You
are only required to read the chapter for the week you are presenting, but
everyone is encouraged to read the chapters. You should supplement your
presentation with outside readings and examples as necessary. You should
actively work to implement the multimedia principles you are discussing in the
design of your presentation. If you are presenting during a synchronous zoom
meeting, you should prepare some questions and prompts to facilitate a discussion.
If your team is working with an asynchronous class, you will post your questions
and prompts in a moddle forum, and you will be responsible for moderating the discussion.
Discussion moderation includes reading all posts promptly, responding with feedback
and follow up questions, and pointing posters to similar (or conflicting) ideas
in other threads.

- **Coherence, Personalization, Segmenting:** Clark, chapters 8, 9, & 10 (3 people)

### Workshops: multimedia tutorial

You will be working alone for your multimedia workshop. For this project you
will create a "how to" or series of "how to" videos that feature a specific
multimedia authoring technique and tool. Choose a multimedia authoring tool that
you know well or want to become expert in. Design a 10-15 minute tutorial that
describes how (and why/when) to use it. Your video should be in the format of a
"quickstart" that isn't comprehensive, but demonstrates the key skills that you
think the rest of us should know to get started. Some of the tools have room for
than one workshop, in this case, one presenter will work on the quickstart video
and the other will feature more advanced topics.Every workshop must also include
a curated list of documentation and other high quality tutorials.

Please post your tutorial(s)on YouTube and post the link in our "multimedia
tutorial" discussion forum (with its own title). Also post the links to docs and
other tutorials here. Monitor the forum for feedback and questions regarding
your tool.


Multimedia project
------------------
The culminating work for this class is your _multimedia project_. Everyone will
work on their own individual project. They will produce a multimedia work that
demonstrates their skills as a designer and producer of multimedia, their
knowledge of the studio topic, and their understanding of the learning sciences
of multimedia.

You should begin thinking about your project during the first week of class. Consider:

- what types of multimedia do you find the most interesting and engaging?
- what are your strengths?
- what would you like to learn more about?
- what skills and demos would you like to highlight as a professional educational technologist?

Past Studio projects include:

- instructional videos
- documentary videos
- animations
- data visualizations
- infographics
- (analog) learning games / card games
- video games
- e-learning courses (captivate, edx)
- self-paced online courses
- simulations
- interactive websites
- mobile/location based learning systems
- interactive stories (Twine)
- multimedia textbooks
- map/spatial multimedia

### Pitch

You will formally pitch your idea for your your final project. The purpose of
the pitch is to propose your project in a way that makes it sound exciting,
worthwhile, and feasible. You want to tell a good story about what you plan to
develop. You should also have some sketches, mockups, sample art, etc. that may
be required to make your point.

Plan for a 5 minute presentation.

### Critique
You will formally present a working prototype of your project to get feedback
from the instructor and your peers. You should have a solid plan for completing
the project. For the critique, you will be assigned a peer evaluator who
will "chair" your critique. The chair will gather feedback for you in each
of the evaluation areas below and share it with you after the session.

**Critique and Final Evaluation Criteria**
_Refer to these criteria for the evaluation of your multimedia project._

#### Originality & innovation
Does the project take a novel approach to teaching with digital media? Does
it combine existing practices in new ways, for a new effect? Does it
address an important topic, or hard to teach concept that is relevant
to the topic of the studio? In other words, how _important_ is the learning
goal for the project?

Students will lose points in originality for verbatim translating of
existing learning solutions to the new problem space.

#### Design
The design of the project encompasses the information, interaction, and
visual design. Points to consider when evaluating the design:

-   is the navigation consistent, logical, and easily understood?
-   does the graphic design engage users?
-   does the look and feel support the learning goals of the project?
-   does the user interface take advantage of existing conventions, UI
    widgets, and user patterns?
-   are there clear paths through the system to accomplish user goals?
-   are system messages and instructions consistent and clear?
-   does the overall design exhibit a level of professionalism and
    polish that supports trust by the user?
-   is the design accessible?
    -   does it support the widest possible range of computer systems
        (including OS, web browser, screen size/mobile, processor speed,
        internet connection quality)
    -   can it be accessed by users with disabilities, where
        appropriate?

#### Technique
The project's technique reflects the proficiency of the producer with the
tools of the digital studio. All aspects of the project should be well
tested for smooth operation. Users should not easily "break" the system.
The specifics of development depend on the media. So, each of the
various skills required for the course will be evaluated based on the
practice of expert practitioners.

-   is video composed and edited like an expert video?
-   does software meet the speed and reliability that an expert would
    expect?
-   etc.

#### Learning science
At the end, this studio challenge is about learning. Points in this
category are awarded for exhibiting a thorough understanding of how
people learn with digital artifacts. Successful projects will account
for the cognitive, social, pragmatic, ethical, and aesthetic
implications of their design, as it impacts learning.
