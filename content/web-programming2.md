**Description:** In this course students learn techniques of web
programming to develop interactive, educational media. Using the
web programming language and web development technologies (HTML5,
Javascript, CSS), students gain practice in the object oriented
programming and design of interactive software. For their final
project, students will create their own interactive educational website.

**Key words:** computer science, web development, python, interaction
design, django, html, html5, css, javascript, OOP

Assignments & Grading
========================================================================

Single Page Website (30%)
-----------------------------------

Students will build a single-page,
informational website on a topic of their choice. Their website
will be composed of HTML, CSS, and (optionally) Javascript. It
will display their fluency with the HTML elements, styling
with CSS, and enhancing user experience with Javascript. The
content of the website is entirely up to the student. They are
encouraged to create a website on something they are already
familiar with and interested in. This is an individual project.

The project will be graded on the following criteria:

1. **Technical design (15 pts):**
    - is html code well formatted and error free?
    - are html elements used appropriately 
      to give semantic structure to the document?
    - are elements combined in ways to make complex layouts?
    - is the document elegant? does it use tags minimally, 
      but in a way that makes it clear for developers to read?
2. **Graphic design (10 pts):**
    - aesthetics
    - usability
    - media (images, video, audio)
    - typography
3. **Information architecture (10 pts):**
    - logical structure of information
    - organization of internal links on page
4. **Impact (5 pts):**
    - does the site deliver an important message?
    - do the design and content (copy) work together?

Single Page Website Redesign (30%)
-----------------------------------
Building on the initial single page websites, students will form pairs or groups
to collaborate to improve and extend their websites.

The new website must:

- be mobile accessible
- include enhanced features using Javascript



Interactive web application (40%)
----------------------------------------

Using Javascript, HTML, and CSS students will design and develop an
ineractive educational website.

Software & Tools
-----------------
The first step in becoming a web developer is to get your computer
set up to start writing code and testing it out. At the very least
you will need a ``text editor`` and a ``web browser``. I'm guessing
you have a web browser already.

This short, curated list is the software we will be using.

* Text Editor
    - [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (free trial, Mac, Win, Linux)
* Browser
    - [Firefox](http://www.firefox.com), our go-to browser, better with [the firebug extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/)
    - [Safari](http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1531), to get a second look
    - [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/), to test you site in Chrome
    - [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie), you might as well take a look in IE, too, either on your old windows box or in emulation
* Source control
    - [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* FTP/SFTP/SCP Clients
    - [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client), cross platform
    - [CyberDuck](http://cyberduck.io/), mac
    - [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php), windows
* Windows stuff
    - [PuTTy](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/), ssh client
    - [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), create a GNU/linux-like terminal on Windows.
      This is a big install, but worth it if you are going to stick with windows
* Linux
    - Linux is a great platform for programmers and web developers
    - many of the software is written/test on linux
    - many guides assume linux
    - your public website, eventually, will run on linux (in all likeliness)
    - so, check out [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and maybe give it
      a shot, especially if you have a Windows laptop
* Virtualization
    - want to try linux but can't commit?
    - want to install IE but hate Windows?
    - give [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) a shot
* Media editing
    - [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) for photo editing and raster images (instead of photoshop)
    - [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) for vector graphics (like SVGs)
    - [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) for editing and creating audio files
    - [LibreOffice Draw](http://www.libreoffice.org/features/draw/) is great for creating charts and diagrams, good for flowcharting and wireframes of software/sites you're working on
    - Color picker: a tool to find the hex or RGB code for colors on your desktop
        - OSX (built-in): [DigitalColor Meter](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/discover-the-digitalcolor-meter-tool-on-your-mac/)
        - Win: [List of Eyedropper](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/eyedroppers-color-pickers-for-designers/ "any one of the Windows ones should work")
