_Special Topics in Education Technology, Spring 2016_


**Keywords:** mlearning, mobile learning, ipad, android,  tablet computing, one-to-one computing, 1:1, mobile first  

**Course description.** New technologies can offer insight and inspiration to improve the way we teach. We'll consider how mobile learning can do this by supporting: interacting with the physical world, personalized instruction, networked collaboration, and multimedia learning. Digging deeper, we'll look at iPads and tablets in schools, to consider how they can best be used to transform teaching and learning.

This is an intensive, blended special topics course. During the first online week, students are expected to engage with the online course elements at least once per day. Assignments will be carried out on the course website on Moodle, with the Slack team communications software, with Padlet, and a variety of other tools, including email. Students **must** check their Aelphi email regularly during the course of this class.

Software & Prerequisites
------------------------

Significant portions of this site take place online, through a variety of
software. Please note the following systems which we will be using. Create
accounts and install necessary software as needed. We expect everyone to have
an iPhone or Android phone for use during the course. We believe that most
students will have access to an iPad (any version), too. Please bring your
iPad to our in-person session. If you do not have access to an android or iOS
mobile device, please let the instructors know.

Moodle
:    Moodle is the center for our online and in-person interaction. [Check out the course Moodle here.](https://moodle.adelphi.edu/course/view.php?id=85636)

Email
:    We will send out important course information via email—you must check your adelphi.edu email account regularly.

Slack
:    [Slack](http://auedtech.slack.com) is team communication software. You should install the mobile client for your phone and/or iPad. Slack conversations are organized into "channels." The channel for this class is #mlearning. If your run into trouble or have questions about the course, **Slack is the best place to ask for help.** Either in the #mlearning channel or with a private message to one of the instructors.

Podcast manager
:    During the course we will release a series of short audio podcasts. As part of our experimentation with mobile learning, we ask that everyone find a podcast client app and install it on their phone or iPad (search for `podcast manager` or `podcast client` in your app store). Once the app is installed, subscribe to our podcast via the RSS link: <http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:214661076/sounds.rss>

Padlet
:    The padlet web and mobile (iOS) apps make it easy to share resources and collaborate on projects. Where Slack let's us hash out ideas, Padlet will allow us to create more organized and permanent work that we can refer back to once our course is over. [Sign up for a padlet account here.](https://padlet.com/auth/signup)

### Participation
This short course requires frequent interaction from all participants. There will be no time to make up missed assignments, or catch up on discussions later on. Specifically, students are responsible for participating via email, Slack, Moodle, and Padlet.

### Scholarly article review
For this assignment you will choose one scholarly article related to mobile learning and a topic of your choosing (e.g. mobile computing and student authored media, or augmented reality games for learning). After reading the article, post a 500 word response.

For your response:

1. Give your forum post its own title.
2. Put the article citation at the top of the post
3. Write a brief summary of the key points of the article you review
4. Write a discussion of the article, considering:
    - its merit (or lack of merit)
    - its implications for teaching and learning
    - connections with your practice or other aspects of learning sciences

### Instructional Design Challenge
During our in-person workshop, the instructors will lead an "instructional design challenge" where participants will be asked to complete a series of curricular and instructional design activities using iPads. _Please bring your iPad (if you have one) and mobile phone to class_.

### mLearning Unit/Design Plan
_Choose one type of project as your final project. Projects can be completed individually or in teams._

**Mobile learning unit**

You will design a mobile learning unit. Specify your target 
audience and setting (museum, K-12, corporate training,
online/informal). Explain the technology you will use in terms of learning goals and pedagogy;
explaining why mobile technologies are a good match for your
instructional design.

_Deliverables:_

1. Unit description
2. Learning goals
3. Lesson plans (3-5 different lessons). Lesson plans should include:
    a. materials needed for the lesson
    b. technology requirements
    c. procedures (i.e. if there's a teacher, what does the teacher do? if it's self-paced, what do the students do?)
    d. assessment/evaluation: how does the learner know that he or she has mastered the material?
4. Materials: any materials needed to complete the lesson
5. A short (1-2 page) reflection on why the unit exhibits best practices in mobile learning

**App for learning design document**

Identify learning goals and design an app to help teach them. Consider how/when the app will be used and what technologies it will need (and if they are feasible). You will turn in a complete design for the app that includes:

1. Overview
2. "User stories" (short, 2-3 sentence narrative descriptions) illustrating how your app would be used
2. Mock-ups/sketches of user interface screens
3. Diagrams showing different information flows
4. Technology report indicating the necessary technologies and considerations for implementing your app
5. A test report, from at least one test session, where you ask potential users (a.k.a. friends or family) to try out your app -- even if they are just trying out pen and paper prototypes, you can still get useful feedback
5. (optional) Any digital prototypes, artwork/design, etc.
6. A short (1-2 page) reflection on why the proposed app exhibits best practices in mobile learning
