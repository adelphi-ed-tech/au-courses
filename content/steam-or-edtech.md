STEAM or Ed Tech?
=================
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
{% capture md %}

MIXI offers two similar Master's degrees: the fully online, asynchronous Master's in Educational 
Technology (MA in Ed Tech) and the hybrid, NYC classroom based Master's in STEAM Teaching and 
Learning (MA in STEAM). The same Adelphi faculty teach in both programs, and both degrees focus on 
understanding the ways new technologies impact teaching and learning, with an emphasis on how we 
design learning environments and learning technologies to support learning.

There are key differences, however, because both programs work take advantage of their modality.
The online MA has a greater emphasis on multimedia design and online learning, while the campus
program focuses on hands-on learning in the Maker Lab and site visits and fieldwork with
New York City schools and local organizations.

_Because Ed Tech is 100% online, international students in Ed Tech cannot get a visa to study in the US._

Both programs attract students with varied backgrounds and interests, including science and math teachers,
computer programmers, artists, and other educators looking to integrate technology into their practice.
The other STEAM tracks (Science, Math, and Computer Science) lead to NYS teaching certification. STEAM Studies,
like Ed Tech, does not lead to a new certification area, but will result in professional certification
for applicants that are already certified teachers in any area.
