**Educational Technology 0858-612, Spring 2021**

**Course description.**
Most of the world connects to the Internet from mobile phones, most of the time. Android
tablets and iPads are filtering into schools — and the hands of
children. Augmented reality and location based software offer new opportunities for
context aware learning. Students carry significant computing power in their pockets.
This course considers how mobile computing forces us to reconsider the
time and place of learning.

**Keywords:** mlearning, mobile learning, android, ipad, tablet computing, AR, augmented reality

Goals & objectives
----------------------------------------

Students taking this course will develop an understanding of the ways
that mobile technologies can be used for teaching and learning. They
will also consider the impact of mobile computing on the field of
education as a whole.

Students will:

-   understand basic underlying mobile technologies, and their
    educational implications
    -   network types and capacity
    -   hardware speed, capabilities, and energy requirements
    -   screen and display technologies
    -   software development platform, including Web, SMS, and local
        “Apps"
    -   GIS and location services, and how they can be used to augment
        learning
    -   augmented reality technologies
-   understand the specific strengths and constraints of mobile
    interactivity & design
-   implement best-practices of teaching with wireless mobile technology
-   reflect on how mobile computing challenges the traditional time and
    places of learning

Weekly topics
----------------------------------------------------
_Readings, discussion forums, and other assignments are
available on the course website under the weekly topic._

_Complete the readings **before** the session listed for hylfex weeks so that
you come to class meetings prepared to discuss. For asynchronous weeks, you
should do the readings early in the week so that you can participate in online
activities that draw on them later in the week._

**Hyflex sessions: Wednesday 4:30-6:20**<br>

### Session leader (pair)

You or you and a partner will be responsible for leading a class session this
semester. For async weeks, you will submit (to the instructor) an audio
introduction to the readings and other materials; during zoom calls you will
begin the session with a short introduction. Plan for about 10 minutes.

If you are leading an asynchronous class session, you will not submit your own
reading response this week, but will play the role of moderator in our online
discussion. You will ask follow up questions to posts and comments, connect
students who address the same subjects but may not have seen each other, post to
keep discussions on track (and civil if needed), and prompt/nudge your peers who
seem to be falling behind.

If you are leading an live class class (via zoom), you will essentially be the seminar or
workshop leader for that week. You should be very familiar with the readings and
come to class with interesting questions and/or quotations from the texts that
you believe will lead to fruitful discussions. If you are leading a workshop,
you will work with the instructor to design activities for the rest of the class
and you will present the tools and facilitate the activities.

### Reading Responses (solo)

For most asynchronous weeks you will be asked to post a _reading response_ on Moodle.
This is the main online interaction for this portion of this course. Your
reading response should be approximately 500 words, but occasionally
may call for more or less.

A good reading response:

1. specifically refers to the readings and other activities due that week: you will usually want to quote the texts and refer to specific passages,
2. your post will start a new thread in our discussion forum, it should have its own unique (and clever) title,
3. is not a _summary_, you should have a point of view and express your own synthesis, understanding, and opinion about the topic under discussion,
4. sometimes this will relate to courses you are taking now, your work, or your personal life,
5. sometimes this will relate to other things you have read or studied (this is okay, just give us a little bit of reference and a way to find more information),
6. is not a formal, academic post (you don't need APA style references), but you should include links, titles, authors names, etc for outside readings/videos/works,
7. _is_ intended for this course and your classmates so it should be **professional** in substance and tone, and
8. **is posted on time**

The general workflow for these online weeks follows:

1. (Wed-Sat) Do course readings
2. (Sat-Mon) Write & post a reading response
3. (Tues-Wed) Read all of the responses and post comments/discuss

In addition to your own response, you should check the discussion board daily.
You are required to comment on at least two of your
peer's responses each week and you should respond to
people who engage with you.

### Tech Report Podcast (pair)

Working in pairs, you will present a “Tech Report” on an aspect of mobile
technology. Teams will prepare 10 minute presentation they will present in
class. In the Moodle forum, each team will post a 1-paragraph abstract of their
presentation and an annotated list of resources (e.g. websites, press, and
scholarly articles) related to their topic. Annotations should only be a few
sentences.

Grading for this assignment will take into account:

- written report on Moodle
- quality and importance of the subject matter
- quality of the presentation

Example topics:

* wireless networks (wimax, mesh networks, p2p networks, 5G/6G)
* near field communications (NFC)
* device hardware (chips screens, etc)
* mobile payments (Google Wallet, Apple Pay, etc)
* GIS/GPS & location
* beacons, RFID, etc
* iOS and Android Platforms
* mobile media (video, audio, animations, web/html/css, etc.)
* speech recognition, text-to-speech, voice interfaces
* facial recognition & computer vision
* AR technologies (Goggles, biometrics, development platforms, etc)
* IoT (microboards, dev platforms, uses, sensors, etc)
* mobile computing and assistive technology
* wireless/mobile security
* virtual assistants (Alexa, Google Home, etc)
* gesture interfaces

### App Inventor app (team)
Working in a team, you will design, develop, and test a mobile app built with
MIT's [app inventor software](https://appinventor.mit.edu/), which allows you
to make mobile Android apps without writing any text-based code. We will all
work on the same theme, which each team presenting their solution. The theme
for the Hackathon will be determined by the class and the instructor. App Inventor
apps only run on Android, but the software includes a simulator that any user
can use from the web. The final product can be installed on an Android phone
or tablet.



### Mini literature review (solo)
For this assignment you will write a report about how mobile technologies are used in
a specific domain of learning. Broadly, your report should focus on a subject area
(e.g. mathematics, language learning, teacher professional development)
or target group/setting (e.g. students with disabilities, higher education, museum education). Your report will include a written portion and then a visual presentation
video where you demonstrate and discuss apps/mobile software related to your topic.

The written report should:

- describe the domain your researching, including an understanding of best pedagogical practices in general (without tech or mobile tech)
- include a literature review of relevant research in mobile learning (if you can't find at least 3 good academic articles, you should choose a different topic)
- the lit review provides both a summary and a synthesis of the research
- describe the software that you will demo and discuss in your video (links to developer, brief summary, etc)

Your report _must_ include specific screenshots (or embedded) videos of mobile
apps that are related to the report, showing how they support (or hinder) learning
objectives.

In class, you will take about 5 minutes to present your report and then answer
questions related to the topic.
