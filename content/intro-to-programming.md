Generative AI / ChatGPT Policy
==============================
Since the introduction of GPT-3, programmers have been using
generative AI as an integral part of their work. Some are
predicting [the end of programming](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/the-end-of-programming/),
but I think it's just another iteration in the tools that computer scientists and software
engineers have at their disposal to create software more quickly and efficiently.
In particular, it can help us learn new things and reduce the risk of trying
something new.

The general rule for this course is that **generative AI can be used for learning**,
but it is a violation of Adelphi's academic honesty policy and
**considered cheating** if you submit work that was generated by AI as your own.

Specifically:

- lab exercises cannot be written by AI 
  (i.e. if you upload the question to ChatGPT and then post its answer, you will risk receiving 0 points)
- you may always ask it about the API, to produce examples (e.g., _show me how to make a bar graph in `Matplotlib_`)
- you may submit your code to AI for suggestions, feedback, and debugging
- you can use AI as a companion in your project code, either to write "routine" code, 
  or help do something new (e.g., _how can I make a map with a legend in `GeoPandas`?_)
- if you incorporate significant AI code in your project, you must document it in comments
  and be prepared to explain it in your final presentation

Please note: it is not that hard for me to spot code you didn't 
write (whether from a friend, AI, a "cheating" website, etc).


Assignments and Grading
=======================

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
{% md %}

| Assignment         | Points |
|--------------------|--------|
| Labs (10 total)    | 30     |
| Midterm project    | 25     |
| Final project      | 25     |
| Participation      | 20     |

### Participation (15%)

You will complete three self-evaluations of your participation in the course
by completing a Google Form. Your self-eval will be averaged with the instructor's
evaluation at the end of the semester.

Because this is a self-evaluation, you will have to set your own criteria for
how you evaluate your participation. Here are some things that I will be looking
for:

- do you set aside time to work on the course each week?
- do you complete labs on time?
- do you ask for help when you are stuck?
- do you help others on slack or over email?
- do you share your work, relevant ideas, and resources?
- do you find time to study or work with other students?
- do you complete assignments on time?
- **do not** abandon your teammates
- do not turn in work written by AI or other students

### Labs (50%)

There will be 10 programming "labs" during the course of the semester.
Each lab will provide a few challenges based on the goals and examples
of the week. You will

- _0 points_: for not turning in any work
- _1-2 points_: for a basic attempt, but code isn't working or has fundamental flaws
- _3 points_: solution works and demonstrates mastery of relevant concepts

Some labs may have bonus problems. You should always try to do the
bonus problems. They are focused more on problems solving and
core "CS" concepts than the project-based exercises. If you submit
a nice bonus solution, you may earn an extra point towards your lab
score (but the total can't exceed 30 points).

Labs are due by midnight on Tuesday of the week they are assigned. To turn
in your lab:

1. Save a copy of the weekly lab to your Colab.
2. Rename it with your last name and the lab number, e.g. `curinga-lab1.ipynb`
3. Share the document with the instructor <mcuringa@adelphi.edu>
{% endmd %}
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
{% md %}

### Midterm: census data analysis (25%)

The midterm will be a pair project that you complete **with your assigned partner**
(see [the roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlRZEpIeROtgi_jB3PX2tyfch1QHsqLYVY_48jEz3H4/edit?usp=sharing)).

For this project you will create your own analysis of the US Census
data that we have been working with. You will investigate a question
that you think can be explored with the data available to us, and
you will use the methods of statistical and spatial analysis to
create a report that includes python code, written analysis,
interactive maps, data tables, and graphs.

Specifically, your Colab Notebook must have:

- all of the code used to create your analysis
- an introduction, headers, written discussion as markdown blocks
- at least one interactive map with points and pop-ups
- at least one table of data
- at least one graph or chart
- markdown text blocks that provide a narrative analysis of the data
  and relevant descriptions of the methods

<h4 class="linkable">Project evaluation criteria</h4>

1. **Content/question:** is the question interesting and important?
   Does the data help us understand it in a new way? Is it analyzed
   in a compelling way?
2. **Programming:** is the code well written and efficient?
   Does it demonstrate mastery of the concepts covered in the course to this point?
   Specifically, you should use variable to make your program more flexible and
   easier to read. Variables should be well named. You shouldn't have any unused 
   code, commented out code, or redundant statements.
3. **Risk:** does the project take a risk? Does it try to do something new or
   different? Low-risk projects very closely resemble the examples and labs;
   high-risk projects try to do something new or different, even if it doesn't
   work exactly right.
4. **Visualization & presentation:** is the map easy to read and easy to use? Can
   the user use the map to explore the data? Is the text edited (no typos, clear prose)?
   Is text formatted in HTML and markdown as needed? Are data tables well formatted
   and have appropriate column headers? Are the charts and graphs selected a good match
   for the data presented? Does the project make good use of color and size to convey
   quantitative information?

_Both team members will receive the same grade for the project. This means
that both members should be prepared to explain any aspect of the project
during the instructor meeting and to demonstrate their ability to write
new code._

### Final project (25%)
The final project will follow the same format as the midterm project,
except everyone will work alone and turn in their own work. The final
can use either census data (from the first half of the term) or school
data from the second half of the term. You must also integrate at least
one data source that is not provided by the instructor.

_The final project will be evaluated on the [same criteria as the midterm](#project_evaluation_criteria)._

Module 9: Exploring data
------------------------
This week you will be presented with several new data sets
available through the `nycschools` library. This package
provides data on all the schools in New York City, combined
from public data sets. Your task will be to use the API
to load data and to explore it in an open-ended manner.

_You will apply your project 1 skills in a new context._

**Goals:**

- experience working with new data and discovering
  features of that data
- choose your own analysis and visualizations

**Topics:**

**Do:**

Module 10: Mapping shapes
------------------------
So far, we have only placed _points_ on our maps. This week
we will plot polygons (shapes) from geospatial data files.
We will learn how to draw boundaries from data, add labels,
control the styles, and use color maps to create data-driven
**choropleth** maps.

[**Lab 8**](#colab link) (due Tuesday)

**Goals:**

- experience working with new data and discovering
  features of that data
- choose your own analysis and visualizations

**Topics:**

**Do:**


Module 11, 12, 13: Stats, data cleaning, spatial queries?
---------------------------------------------------------
These three weeks are left intentionally blank. It's
tough to have a student-directed learning experience
if everything is planned before we have met. There
are many topics to cover, so we will choose which ones
to focus on based on interest and the types of projects
students are pursuing.

We may want to take a deeper dive into statistical analysis.
We might want to add multiple layers and controls to the
maps. Maybe we want to collect data from more sources, including
live data streams, "scraped" data that isn't ready immediately
ready for analysis (and must be cleaned), or text data that
requires some natural language processing. We might also
want to focus on making highly polished visuals, making
interactive graphs or integrating more advanced HTML/CSS
into our work. Almost certainly we will do further spatial
analysis, learning how to find where shapes overlap and border,
which points are contained within which shapes, etc.

In short, there are many possibilities and studying
any of them will help us gain a deeper understanding
of computer science, software engineering, and computer
programming.

**Goals:**


**Topics:**

**Do:**



Module 14: Final studio 
------------------------
This week will focus on getting your
final project in shape for the beta test
in week 15.


Module 15: Beta testing
-----------------------
This week you will share your progress with the class in order
to receive feedback, ask for help, and learn from each other.

**Goals:**

- get feedback on project
- find bugs and areas of confusion


**Do:**

Module 16: Final meetings
-------------------------
You will schedule your final one-on-one meeting with the
instructor to demo your final project and solve some
computing problems to show what you learned during the semester.
