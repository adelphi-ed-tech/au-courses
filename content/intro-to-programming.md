Learning Goals
==============

* understand the types of problems that can be solved using computational techniques
* understand the basic concepts of computation (CPU, RAM, permanent storage, GUIs, file systems, network connections)
* learn core computer programming concepts (abstraction, variables, conditions, functions, repetition, recursion)
* think algorithmically to design and test computer programs
* master the basic syntax and idioms of the Python programming language
* use technical documentation, APIs, and the internet to learn new technical concepts
* develop step-by-step problem solving and debugging practices

Required Software/Online Accounts
=================================
1. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). This is a 
   free, online programming environment which you will access through your Adelphi email.
2. [Join our Slack](https://auedtech.slack.com/) with your mail.adelphi.edu email.
   - install the desktop client so that you can easily share code and screenshots
   - install the mobile client so that you can stay tuned for messages about the class
   - join the `#code` channel for discussions related to this class
   - DM the instructor at `@mxc` to get in touch
3. [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/). Since it's release, I have used ChatGPT as a 
   resource for my own software development projects. I think it will be very beneficial 
   for you, too. Create an account at <https://chat.openai.com/auth/login> to get started. 
   You can use your AU email, but that's not required.
4. **Screenshot software.** To get help, you might need to share a screenshot (more often you will 
   copy-paste code or error messages). Don't take pictures of your laptop with you phone. 
   Take a screenshot. If you need help setting this up or getting recommendations, ask on `#code`
   on slack.

Required Books
===============
_None. All course readings, videos, etc will be provided online._

Assignments and Grading
=======================

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
{% md %}

| Assignment         | Points |Due date|
|--------------------|--------|--------|
| Labs (10 total)    | 30     |ongoing |
| Midterm project    | 25     |Oct 17  |
| Final project      | 25     |Dec 12  |
| Participation      | 20     |ongoing |

### Participation (15%)

You will complete three self-evaluations of your participation in the course
by completing a Google Form. Your self-eval will be averaged with the instructor's
evaluation at the end of the semester.

Because this is a self-evaluation, you will have to set your own criteria for
how you evaluate your participation. Here are some things that I will be looking
for:

- do you set aside time to work on the course each week?
- do you complete labs on time?
- do you ask for help when you are stuck?
- do you help others on slack or over email?
- do you share your work, relevant ideas, and resources?
- do you find time to study or work with other students?
- **do not** abandon your teammates
- do not turn in work written by AI or other students

### Labs (50%)


There will be 10 programming "labs" during the course of the semester.
Each lab will provide a few challenges based on the goals and examples
of the week. You will

- _0 points_: for not turning in any work
- _1-2 points_: for a basic attempt, but code isn't working or has fundamental flaws
- _3 points_: solution works and demonstrates mastery of relevant concepts

Labs are due by midnight on Tuesday of the week they are assigned. To turn
in your lab:

1. Save a copy of the weekly lab to your Colab.
2. Rename it with your last name and the lab number, e.g. `curinga-lab1.ipynb`
3. Share the document with the instructor <mcuringa@adelphi.edu>
{% endmd %}
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
{% md %}

### Midterm

The midterm will be a pair project that you complete **with your assigned partner**
(see [the roster](#roster)).

### Final project (25%)

For the final project you will work in a team of 2-3 people to create your own
data analysis and visualization using a data set that is available for
download or as a live open data set such as the [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).



Of course, you may incorporate other data sets as you see fit.


**The final solution will be scored using the following guide:**



**Solution (7 points)**

How well does the program written solve the problem? Does the project seriously
engage with the data? Does it use compute analysis to provide interesting
insights? Is the data presented in a meaningful and usable way?

Your team's ability to design a solution to the problem is evaluated by this measure.


**Elegance & Robustness (8 points)**

This area evaluates the quality of the computer code produced by the team. An
_elegant_ program provides a parsimonious solution that is both efficient and
clear. A _robust_ program is flexible and able to change. In the case of data
analysis, it would be easy to modify if the input data changed or the output
requirements are updated. It wouldn't "break" if it encountered unexpected data,
and would continue to operate even if the amount of data were increased
dramatically. Often, both elegance and robustness are achieved through
_refactoring_: the process of reflecting on code and revising it after an initial
working solution is achieved.

**Risk Taking (5 points)**

Learning should be an adventure. One of the most exciting things about writing
software is the sense of new possibilities and discovery. The "risk taking"
aspect of your team's grade will reflect the chances that you take with your
project. Even if your solution isn't quite what you hoped for, or your code
isn't as elegant as you'd like, it's important that you take chances and try new
things. To do well in this section, you might want to shoot for an ambitious, or
complex analysis; or integrate some Javascript libraries or techniques that haven't been
explicitly covered in the course.

**Code Style (5 points)**

Your code should be well formatted and easy to read. Your functions and
variables (aka "identifiers") should have clear, meaningful names. Comments
should be used sparingly, but appropriately to guide the human reader through
your code.

_All project members will receive the same grade._

Class Sessions
==============
We're going to operate this async course on a Wednesday to Wednesday schedule.
That means that each Wednesday, will start a new module, and the lab
for that week will be due by end of day on the following Tuesday.
Modules will generally start with an audio introduction to the materials
and a link to a Google Colab notebook. The notebook will contain
all links to all other readings and videos, as well as sample code
and lab exercises.
