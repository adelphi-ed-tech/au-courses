**Computer Science 0145-602, Fall 2019**

**Keywords:**  computer programming, CS1, javascript, computational thinking, critical computational literacy, problem solving

**Description:** This course introduces students to programming and
some core concepts of computer science, using a modern, object oriented
programming language. Students learn concepts of
variables, functions, selection, repetition/loops, basic data structures
(arrays, lists, hashtables), and basic object oriented programming.

> decreasingly capable of making or even using them effectively.<br>

Assignments and Grading
=======================

Assignment              Pct   Due date
-------------------     ----  --------
Labs (10 total)         50%   ongoing
Midterm exam            25%   Oct 17
Final project           25%   Dec 12


Labs (50%)
-------------------------

Most weeks there will be a programming lab due. Labs will consist of a single exercise
that focuses on using the computer programming concepts we're learning to solve
a problem. Each lab will be worth 0-5 points. Roughly:

- _0 points_: for not turning in any work
- _1-2 points_: for a basic attempt, but code isn't working or has fundamental flaws
- _3-4 points_ (mostly) solution demonstrates mastery of relevant concepts
- _5 points_: solution works, demonstrates mastery of concepts, and is well formatted and clearly written

Everyone's lowest grade will be thrown out (so your lab score will be the
average of your 9 highest lab grades).

Midterm (25%)
--------------------------------

The midterm will consist of 5 "short answer" styled problems where you write
a function for each prompt to solve a specific problem. The short answer prompts
will be very similar to the textbook exercises from _Think JS_. This section
is worth 10 points.

Part 2 of the exam will require writing a longer program that consists of several
functions. Students will choose to answer 1 of 3 possible problems. The
program should demonstrate the student's ability to break down a problem and
write a working computer program that provides a solution.

Final project (25%)
-----------------------------

For the final project you will work in a team of 2-3 people to create your own
data analysis and visualization using a data set that is available for
download or as a live open data set such as the [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).



Of course, you may incorporate other data sets as you see fit.


**The final solution will be scored using the following guide:**

<div class="pl-2">

**Solution (7 points)**

How well does the program written solve the problem? Does the project seriously
engage with the data? Does it use compute analysis to provide interesting
insights? Is the data presented in a meaningful and usable way?

Your team's ability to design a solution to the problem is evaluated by this measure.


**Elegance & Robustness (8 points)**

This area evaluates the quality of the computer code produced by the team. An
_elegant_ program provides a parsimonious solution that is both efficient and
clear. A _robust_ program is flexible and able to change. In the case of data
analysis, it would be easy to modify if the input data changed or the output
requirements are updated. It wouldn't "break" if it encountered unexpected data,
and would continue to operate even if the amount of data were increased
dramatically. Often, both elegance and robustness are achieved through
_refactoring_: the process of reflecting on code and revising it after an initial
working solution is achieved.

**Risk Taking (5 points)**

Learning should be an adventure. One of the most exciting things about writing
software is the sense of new possibilities and discovery. The "risk taking"
aspect of your team's grade will reflect the chances that you take with your
project. Even if your solution isn't quite what you hoped for, or your code
isn't as elegant as you'd like, it's important that you take chances and try new
things. To do well in this section, you might want to shoot for an ambitious, or
complex analysis; or integrate some Javascript libraries or techniques that haven't been
explicitly covered in the course.

**Code Style (5 points)**

Your code should be well formatted and easy to read. Your functions and
variables (aka "identifiers") should have clear, meaningful names. Comments
should be used sparingly, but appropriately to guide the human reader through
your code.

_All project members will receive the same grade._
