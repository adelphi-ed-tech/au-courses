Generative AI / ChatGPT Policy
==============================
Since the introduction of GPT-3, programmers have been using
generative AI as an integral part of their work. Some are
predicting [the end of programming](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/the-end-of-programming/),
but I think it's just another iteration in the tools that computer scientists and software
engineers have at their disposal to create software more quickly and efficiently.
In particular, it can help us learn new things and reduce the risk of trying
something new.

The general rule for this course is that **generative AI can be used for learning**,
but it is a violation of Adelphi's academic honesty policy and
**considered cheating** if you submit work that was generated by AI as your own.
**You must disable Gemini in your Google Colab environment.**
[Settings-->AI Assistance--> Hide generative AI features ]

Specifically:

- lab exercises cannot be written by AI 
  (i.e. if you upload the question to ChatGPT and then post its answer, you will risk receiving 0 points)
- you may always ask it about the API, to produce examples (e.g., _show me how to make a bar graph in `Matplotlib_`)
- you may submit your code to AI for suggestions, feedback, and debugging
- you can use AI as a companion in your project code, either to write "routine" code, 
  or help do something new (e.g., _how can I make a map with a legend in `GeoPandas`?_)
- if you incorporate significant AI code in your project, you must document it in comments
  and be prepared to explain it in your final presentation

Please note: it is not that hard for me to spot code you didn't 
write (whether from a friend, AI, a "cheating" website, etc).


Assignments and Grading
=======================

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
{% md %}

| Assignment         | Points |
|--------------------|--------|
| Labs (10 total)    | 30     |
| Midterm project    | 25     |
| Final project      | 30     |
| Participation      | 15     |

### Participation (15%)

You will complete three self-evaluations of your participation in the course
by completing a Google Form. Your self-eval will be averaged with the instructor's
evaluation at the end of the semester.

Because this is a self-evaluation, you will have to set your own criteria for
how you evaluate your participation. Here are some things that I will be looking
for:

- do you set aside time to work on the course each week?
- do you complete labs on time?
- do you ask for help when you are stuck?
- do you help others on slack or over email?
- do you share your work, relevant ideas, and resources?
- do you find time to study or work with other students?
- do you complete assignments on time?
- **do not** abandon your teammates
- do not turn in work written by AI or other students

### Labs (30%)

There will be 10 programming "labs" during the course of the semester.
Each lab will provide a few challenges based on the goals and examples
of the week. You will

- _0 points_: for not turning in any work
- _1-2 points_: for a basic attempt, but code isn't working or has fundamental flaws
- _3 points_: solution works and demonstrates mastery of relevant concepts

Some labs may have bonus problems. You should always try to do the
bonus problems. They are focused more on problems solving and
core "CS" concepts than the project-based exercises. If you submit
a nice bonus solution, you may earn an extra point towards your lab
score (but the total can't exceed 30 points).

Labs are due by midnight on Tuesday of the week they are assigned. To turn
in your lab:

1. Save a copy of the weekly lab to your Colab.
2. Rename it with your last name and the lab number, e.g. `curinga-lab1.ipynb`
3. Share the document with the instructor <mcuringa@adelphi.edu>
{% endmd %}
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
{% md %}

### Midterm: census data analysis (25%)

The midterm will be a pair project that you complete **with your assigned partner**
(see [the roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlRZEpIeROtgi_jB3PX2tyfch1QHsqLYVY_48jEz3H4/edit?usp=sharing)).

For this project you will choose an area of interest in the United States
Census ACS data set. You will create a Jupyter Notebook in Colab
that loads this data, cleans it, explores and describes the data,
and demonstrates how it can be used.

Your Notebook must include:

- the code to load and clean the data
- better column names for the data, following our class conventions
- a mardkown **data dictionary** describing each field
- markdown analysis of interesting patterns and findings supported
  by the data and code
- merging the census data with spatial data

Specifically, your Colab Notebook must have:

- all of the code used to create your analysis
- an introduction, headers, written discussion as markdown blocks
- at least one interactive map with shapes, points, a color map, tool tips, and popups
- at least two tables of data
  - tables must be well formatted/styled
  - at least one table must use grouped data and aggregate functions
- markdown text blocks that provide a narrative analysis of the data
  and relevant descriptions of the methods

<h4 class="linkable">Project evaluation criteria</h4>

1. **Content/question:** is the data set chosen interesting and relevant? 
   does the code and written analysis present engaging, preliminary findings?
2. **Programming:** is the code well written and efficient?
   Does it demonstrate mastery of the concepts covered in the course to this point?
   Specifically, you should use variable to make your program more flexible and
   easier to read. Variables should be well named. You shouldn't have any unused 
   code, commented out code, or redundant statements.
3. **Risk:** does the project take a risk? Does it try to do something new or
   different? Low-risk projects very closely resemble the examples and labs;
   high-risk projects try to do something new or different, even if it doesn't
   work exactly right.
4. **Visualization & presentation:** is the map easy to read and easy to use? Can
   the user use the map to explore the data? Is the text edited (no typos, clear prose)?
   Is text formatted in HTML and markdown as needed? Are data tables well formatted
   and have appropriate column headers and output? Are the charts and graphs selected 
   a good match for the data presented? Does the project make good use of color and 
   size to convey quantitative information?

_Both team members will receive the same grade for the project. This means
that both members should be prepared to explain any aspect of the project
during the instructor meeting and to demonstrate their ability to write
new code._

### Final project (30%)
The final project will follow the same format as the midterm project,
except everyone will work alone and turn in their own work.The final
project offers you a chance to make more complex maps and visualizations
and it is your opportunity to demonstrate everything you have learned
this semester. There are no strict requirements for the elements
of your work, but it should include a mix of written analysis in markdown,
formatted tables, interactive charts, and interactive maps. To add
complexity to the work you began in the midterm project, you will
probably want to use Census variables from more than one table, look
at multiple years, compare regions, etc.

_The final project will be evaluated on the [same criteria as the midterm](#project_evaluation_criteria)._
