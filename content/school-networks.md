Class Information
=================
- **Instructor:** Matt Curinga <mcuringa@adelphi.edu>
- **Class dates:** May 26 - July 1
- **Live sessions:** Wednesdays: 4:30pm - 6:20pm; <small>zoom link on moodle</small>

Course Communications
=====================

This online course will have a mix of synchronous and asynchronous assignments.
The synchronous sessions, "live lab," will be held each Wednesday, via Zoom,
4:30pm to 6:20pm.

Participants in this course must actively participate in our suite of online
communications tools, including Slack (<https://auedtech.slack.com>),
Adelphi email, and the course website.

You _must_ check your Adelphi email and the `#code` channel on Slack **at least
once a day during this short summer course.** It is highly recommended that you
install the Slack mobile client and an email client on your mobile phone so that
you receive "push notifications" of course announcements.

The best place to post general course questions and any content-related questions
is the `#code` Slack channel. The instructor, as well
as other students and alums, monitor this channel and often provide immediate support.
You are encouraged to contact the instructors at any time via email or direct
message on Slack.

### Online tools:

- **Moodle:** will be used to post the syllabus and links to weekly readings,
  videos, and discussions.
- **Zoom:** for class meetings and help (via screen sharing), please join Zoom
  from your laptop so that you can share your screen to demo work and
  troubleshoot problems. You have should have a calendar invite to our meetings
  with the link. The link is also on Moodle in the course header.
- **Slack:** will be our main channel for online communications.
  Please [Join our Slack team with your Adelphi email](https://auedtech.slack.com/signup).
  If you run into trouble or have a question, post it here to our channel, `#code`,
  or send a message to `@mxc`. During the weeks of the class, we recommend running
  the Slack app for you phone.
- **Trello:** is project management software that you will use to track/plan
  your two projects, and to share your progress with the course instructors.
  Create a [Trello Account](https://trello.com/signup) before the first week of
  class, and (optionally) [install the mobile app](https://trello.com/platforms).        
- **mail.adelphi.edu email:** we will use your official adelphi student email
  for class email communications. Please check this email regularly.

_You should already be comfortable with these skills, or should be prepared to
learn them during the course. Teaching them is not part of the course content._

- Taking screen shots [mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) [win](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/7-ways-to-take-screenshots-in-windows-10-and-11/ ) [linux](https://itsfoss.com/using-gnome-screenshot-tool/)
- Make a screen recording [Quicktime / Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/quicktime-player/record-your-screen-qtp97b08e666/mac) [OBS / all platforms](https://obsproject.com/)

### Getting remote help:

Because of the hands on nature of working with computers and networks, you
will have to use a variety of tools to get help. Your first stop for help should
be #code on Slack. You are most likely to get quick help if you post here
because anyone in the channel (instructors, other students, other faculty, ed tech alums)
can lend a hand.

For more complicated problems, you will need to be able to:

- [post formatted code in slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages)
- take a screenshot from your computer (_unless absolutely necessary, don't send photos of your screen taken with your phone_)

==================

Textbooks
---------
There are no required

Desktop/Laptop
--------------
You must have access to a desktop or laptop computer running Linux, Windows, or
MacOS to participate in this course. Further, you must have an administrative
account where you can fully configure the computer and install software. "Work"
computers where you are not an admin are not sufficient. If your hard drive
doesn't have at least 10GB of free space, you should start clearing space or
purchase an external drive.

You will use this computer to participate in the course online and to complete
the course projects and activities. You can use a phone or tablet for some
online elements of the course, however you will not be able to complete course
assignments without access to a computer where you are able to install software.

Participation
------------------
Because this is a short summer course (3 credits in 6 weeks), you should budget
10-15 hours each week for course work. Wednesday live lab sessions are required,
but you will also spend significant time working through course materials at your
own pace.

Your participation grade will consider preparation for live labs, timely
management of your Trello projects, completion of the comprehension quizzes, and
participation in Slack and Moodle discussions. Smaller (ungraded) weekly
assignments will also be considered for your participation grade. You may earn
bonus participation points if you go "above and beyond" in a week, especially
by providing help or making full use of our classroom tools to ask good questions
and share work.

Quiz Design
-----------
Working in a team of 3, you will be responsible for designing a 15 question quiz
(via Google Forms) to check the basic understanding of the videos and readings
for the week. The quizzes should consist of multiple choice (one answer or
multiple "all that apply") questions that can be automatically scored. You
must provide a detailed answer key for every question. The questions should not
be overly challenging, but should be based on the readings (not general knowledge).
Anyone who carefully completes the readings should be able to score 13/15 points
or better.

Quizzes are **ungraded** for the students taking them. Your team will receive
a group grade for the quiz considering:

- _coverage:_ did the quiz cover all of the big ideas in the readings?
- _depth:_ are the questions challenging without being tricks or requiring
  detailed synthesis of the materials? do they avoid being to specific or two
  general?
- _explanations:_ do the answer keys for each questions appropariately explain
  the correct and incorrect answers?

[See the docs page for making quizzes with Google Forms.](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7032287?hl=en)

Your quiz will be due by end of day on Tuesday and posted to the Moodle
"Weekly Quiz" discussion as a new topic for your week. Please, also, leave
comments and feedback for the quiz authors -- but not until after the quiz is
closed. Everyone must attempt the quiz before the start of class at 4:30 on
Wed.

Web Software Project
--------------------
For the first project, you will install the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.org) OS as a
_guest_ operating system on your computer. You will use Ubuntu to configure
a server running one of the following popular web-based software systems:

1. [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
2. [Moodle](https://moodle.org/)
3. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/)

Once you have the software installed, you will customize it for a specific use
(that you decide). For example, you might configure WordPress as a classroom
website, Moodle to support a summer course, or Ghost to host a personal
newsletter or blog.

_Submission Guidelines_

To submit this project, you will upload a narrated screencast video of your
project to VoiceThread (you can sign in with your Adelphi email account). If you do
not want the video to be public, change the permissions so that it is an
"unlisted" video. Only people with the link will be able to see it. Create a new
thread in the discussion forum with a title for your project. Post the link to
your video here, along with any supporting documentation (screenshots, code,
config files).

Begin the video with a description of who the target users are of this software
and what your goals are for them. Next, show your project from the user's
perspective, showing how it meets the needs of the use cases that guided you in
designing the project. Next, you can, if appropriate, give a brief tour of the
configuration files and scripts that make your project possible. Your video
should be 5-6 minutes long.

Please take time to watch your classmate's videos and post comments, questions,
and suggestions.

_This is an individual project._

Final Group Project
-------------------
One of the key technical tasks of an educational technologist or instructional
designer is to research and evaluate possible solutions to a problem and then
implement a plan to test a possible solution. Real world problems often require
the combination of several systems in a new way, suffer from incomplete or
inaccurate documentation, and are hindered by time or resources/financial
constraints.

With this in mind, you will choose a software project that you find interesting and
engaging to pursue for your final project. You will be responsible for
gathering/purchasing the materials to complete the project.

You will be evaluated on:

- skill with the linux operating system
- ability to customize your solution to meet the project's goals
- creativity of the project chosen
- risk/scope of the project
- reflection on the process

This is a _group project_ with either 2 or three people per team. You and your
team will work on the same project. You will share a Trello and set goals
together. It will be up to you to decide who work is divided and the most
effective way to collaborate and share resources.


Here are a few raspberry project ideas that will give you a sense of the size and
scope of what you can do for your final project.

1. **MyCroft Open Source personal assistant**<br>
   <https://mycroft.ai><br>
   MyCroft is a Free Software alternative to systems such as Alexa and Google
   Assistant. MyCroft is developed for Linux. It requires some attention to
   details to get all of the media components working properly. For this
   project, you will download and configure MyCroft for your VM; create and
   connect to your online account, configure and test the microphone and audio
   output, and customize the features and functionality of your RPI assistant.
   Start at the [mycroft site](https://mycroft.ai) for all of the information
   you need to get started.
2. **Jupyter Hub collaborative programming site**<br>
   <https://jupyter.org/hub><br>
   Jupyter Hub is a collaborative version of the Jupyter Notebook software development
   environment. Set up a Jupyter Hub installation on your VM and configure it for
   use in a programming, math, or other learning environment that requires a
   shared coding environment.
3. **Ghost/Moodle/WordPress**<br>
   While you _had_ to set up a basic version of these systems for the first project,
   they are complex softare systems with many templates, plug-ins, and customizations.
   Your team may choose to work on one of these to create a more complete
   website.
4. **Mattermost chat server**<br>
   <https://mattermost.org><br>
   Mattermost is a FOSS chat sever (similar to Slack) that you can host on your
   own sever for privacy and customizability.
5. **MagicMirror digital kiosk**<br>
   <https://magicmirror.builders/><br>
   The magic mirror or smart mirror runs a customizable web server that serves
   as a digital kiosk (and, if desired, a magic mirror -- a mirrored LCD monitor).
   Install the base
6. **Slack chatbot**<br>
   Using the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/), set up a server (e.g. Node or Python)
   and create an "app" that interacts, automatically, with Slack chat.
7. **Jekyll website**<br>
   <https://jekyllrb.com/><br>
   Create a simple, static website using the Jekyll system and markdown syntax.
   Host it live on your own Github Pages site.

These are only a few suggestions. If you have something that you want to build,
but aren't sure the best way to accomplish it, please post your idea in Slack
and we can investigate solutions as a team.

_Submission Guidelines_

To submit this project, you will upload a narrated screencast video of your
project to VoiceThread. Begin the video with a description of who the target
users are of this setup and what your goals are for them. Next, show your
project from the user's perspective, showing how it meets the needs  of the use
cases that guided you in designing the project. Next, you can, if appropriate,
give a brief tour of the configuration files and scripts that make your project
possible. Your video should be 8-10 minutes long. Submit one video per team.

4. Getting ready for next week: terminal basics

Week 2: The Command Line
------------------------
This week we will learn how to interact with our computer using the command line
(aka terminal). The command line interface (CLI) offers an alternative to the
graphical user interface (GUI) we are more familiar with. Wile the terminal
hearkens back to the early days of computing, its still very much alive for
systems administrators, software developers, and others. In particular, complex
tasks can be accomplished with a few lines of text, remote computers can be
easily accessed, and all manner of tasks can be automated (and scheduled).
Specifically, after gaining fluency with the command line, you will be able to
connect to a remote Linux server from your regular laptop or desktop computer in
order to configure and control it. To get started on the command line we'll
check out Terminus, a game developed at MIT to introduce the players to the
command line.

In addition to jumping into the command line, by the end of the week you will
have customized your VM by installing software packages through `apt` and the
GUI. You will also choose your topic for the first project and set up a Trello
with a Board for your project and milestones for each week until it's due.

### Guiding Questions:
1. How is a command line interface different from the more familiar graphical
   user interface?
2. What is gained from a CLI? What is lost?

### Watch, Play, & Read:
1. Read [What is Free Software?](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
2. Watch [Keyboards & Command Line Interfaces: Crash Course Computer Science #22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?embed=0&v=4RPtJ9UyHS0)[11:23]

1. Welcome, questions
2. Command line Quizlet
3. Breakout rooms:
   A. WordPress working group
   B. Moodle working group
   C. Ghost working group
4. Project ideas and Trello Updates

Week 3: Users, Groups, Files, & Permissions
-------------------------------------------
As you're working on finishing up your first project, we'll take a deeper look
at how files, permissions and security works in linux/unix operating systems. To
better understand how to work with files, we'll take a look at file archives
(multiple files and directories combined in a single file) and compression
(reducing the size of a file). Because your programs all run as a "user" (either
root or their own user), it's important to understand files and permissions to
troubleshoot problems.

### Guiding Questions:
1. How do you secure digital resources?
2. Is the unix approach of users and groups sufficient for all security needs?

### Watch & Read:
1. Watch [Files & File Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?embed=0&v=KN8YgJnShPM) [12:02]
2. Watch [Compression: Crash Course Computer Science #21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?embed=0&v=OtDxDvCpPL4) [12:47]
3. Read [Understanding Basic File Permissions and ownership in Linux](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/understanding-basic-file-permissions-and-ownership-in-linux/)
4. Watch [Linux Terminal 201: How To Use tar, gzip, bzip2, and zip - HakTip 156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?embed=0&v=f8-7lhs4ky0) [11:32]

6. Docs [How To Extract Zip, Gz, Tar, Bz2, 7z, Xz and Rar File in Linux](https://tecadmin.net/extract-archive-file-linux/)

### To Do:
1. Finish the first project
2. Complete the "Users & Groups" quiz


### Live Lab Agenda
_project working session_

Week 4: Networks
----------------
How does the internet work? What happens after you hit enter on a search term
on [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/spread)? How does Spotify get music
to your phone then to your wireless earbuds? A deeper understanding of different
networking hardware, software, and protocols will help us better understand
the networked software we're installing, configuring, and troubleshooting.

### Guiding Questions:
1. How does the internet work as a collection of networks?
2. How does a multi-layered model allow for abstraction between different layers?

### Watch:
1. [How the Internet Works in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?embed=0&v=7_LPdttKXPc) [4:48]
2. [The Internet: IP Addresses & DNS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?embed=0&v=5o8CwafCxnU) [6:44]

### To Do:
1. Post (with a partner) a written report on one of the network topics (see full instructions below).
2. Choose a topic and form a team for the final project. Create a Trello board
   for it and share it with your partners and the instructor.
3. Complete the "Networks & Internet" quiz.

### Networking Topic Report Instructions
For a more in-depth look at networking, you will work with a partner to write
a mini report on a related topic. Please: a) choose a partner, and b) choose a
topic from the list below. If you have an idea for a different topic, you may
write about that with approval from the instructors. By the end of the week,
please post your report directly into our _Networking Topics_ forum. Your report
should be roughly 500-800 words. It should give an overview of the topic,
summary of how it works, and discussion of how it's used and why it is (or
isn't) important. Read through the other posts, and ask any follow-up questions.
The instructor and topic authors will do their best to answer your questions.

Possible topics:

 1. Bluetooth
 2. Mesh network
 3. Near Field Communication (NFC)
 4. HTTPS/SSL
 5. 4g/5g/6g
 6. BitTorrent
 7. Dark Web
 8. Radio-frequency identification (RFID)
 9. Bluetooth Beacons
 10. Web3

Week 5: Ethics
-------------------------------------
[As Spider-Man learned](https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/17610/spider-man_with_great_power._2008_1),
with great power comes great responsibility. We trust the people who run our
networks to keep our information safe, and to not violate our trust while they
do it. Along the way, they may face some hard choices, usually weighing the benefits
of individuals versus the group. We'll take a look at some of the ethical concerns
in "big tech", and also investigate how these same concerns appear in the context
of schools and other educational institutions.

### Guiding Questions:

1. How do school systems balance student privacy and autonomy, with safety and learning efficiency?
2. What are the key ethical concerns of embedding corporate interests (and technology) into public spaces like schools?

### Read:
1. **Monitoring Student Social Media**
