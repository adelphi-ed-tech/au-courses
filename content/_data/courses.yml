    In this course, students investigate methods for determining 
    if a given technology contributes to a stronger educational experience. 
    Reviewing the body of research on educational technology, students will
    probe the merits of different methodologies. Students learn how to 
    develop good research questions and choose methodologies to conduct 
    their own investigations.

    How can digital media best support learning?
    Working on semester-long projects, students learn about interaction
    and instructional design. In this hands-on studio, develop and
    extend skills in multimedia authoring: digital images/audio/video,
    and interactive web development. Apply these skills to create a
    original educational resources. Each studio has its own theme.
    Previous studios have focused on creating multimedia to explore:
    information security, school segregation, smart cities, generative AI,
    and more.

    Most of the world connects to the Internet from mobile phones, most of the time.
    Chromebooks, Android tablets and iPads have made one-to-one computing a reality
    in many U.S. school systems. Augmented reality and location based software offer
    new opportunities for context aware learning. Students carry significant
    computing power in their pockets. This course considers how mobile computing
    forces us to reconsider the time and place of learning.

    Video games have become an increasingly important source 
    of culture and entertainment in our society. They are 
    more popular than Hollywood movies, yet receive a fraction 
    of the attention, especially in academia. In recent years, 
    this has been changing, as scholars have begun to interrogate 
    games from many levels: design, critique, and as a means of 
    learning. In this course, we really have 3 separate, 
    but overlapping goals: 1) to understand video games 
    as a social and cultural phenomenon, especially 
    important to youth culture; 2) to think of ways 
    to teach _about_ video games, as part of a (digital) 
    literacy perspective; and 3) to investigate ways 
    to teach with games, both off the shelf and ones 
    that we design ourselves.

    Students will learn how to use data to improve learning, and how to critique
    the use of data in education. No prior experience with computer programming
    or statistics is required, but students will be learning to use both in this course.
