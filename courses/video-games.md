## Description
Video games have become an increasingly important source of culture and entertainment in our society. They are more popular than Hollywood movies, yet receive a fraction of the attention, especially in academia. In recent years, this has been changing, as scholars have begun to interrogate games from many levels: design, critique, and as a means of learning. In this course, we really have 3 separate, but overlapping goals: 1) to understand video games as a social and cultural phenomenon, especially important to youth culture; 2) to think of ways to teach _about_ video games, as part of a (digital) literacy perspective; and 3) to investigate ways to teach _with_ games, both off the shelf and ones that we design ourselves.

## Who should take this course
This course is open to anyone who is interested in how people learn from video games. We will look at games from various perspectives: cognitive, social, ethical, design, pragmatic, etc. You do not need specific technical experience in developing games and you do not need to be a "gamer" to join us.

## Goals
The course has two main goals. Firstly, it introduces students to a range of game genres that have been popular in education. Secondly, it covers a range of learning principles, research topics, controversies, and potential applications for video games and simulations in education, and gives students the foundations for applying both analog and digital games in educational contexts.

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

1. Understand major topics in educational games and simulations
2. Situate video games and learning in its historical manifestations - military exercises, simulations, game theory, board games and digital (video) games
3. Understand the difference between exogenous and endogenous games, and design a simple endogenous game that can be used to teach a specific topic
4. Understand the key differences between popular game genres
5. Analyze and reflect on the potential of existing games and their potential in educational contexts

## Using this syllabus
Here are just a few notes on how this course is organized and how to use this syllabus. **Reading assignments**, wherever possible, link to openly available versions of the article. This makes this syllabus useful to the widest audience, and to students when they are not logged into the Adelphi network. When this is not possible, reading links refer to files uploaded to the Moodle course website. You _must_ be logged into Moodle before you can retrieve these articles.

All **game response posts** are due on the course website (i.e. Moodle). You should follow the rule: post once, comment twice. That is, after you post your own response, read what others have posted and let them know what you think.

**Game play assignments** refer to games that are available in the game study center in Harvey 104. If the game is not in the lab, more specific instructions will be available.

### Participation & Professionalism Rubric
On the last day of class, students will turn in their "professionalism rubric", a self-evaluation of their contributions to class. The rubric considers:

* attendance & punctuality
* in class participation
* online participation
* group participation
* promptness of assignments

### Gaming autobiography
You will create a 5 minute presentation with the theme: _my gaming autobiography_. Your presentation will consist of 1 title slide with your name, title of presentation, and then exactly 10 content slides. Plan to spend exactly 30 seconds on each slide &mdash; they will be set to auto-advance.

Your presentation should focus on how games have been influential in your life. Please don't tell us every game you've ever played, rather consider key games (and other types of play) that have been meaningful to you in some way. You can include digital (video) games, as well as other games/play (such as athletics). You might talk about the social experience of playing the games, how playing them affected you, negative or positive consequences of play, etc.

Your presentation will be evaluated on several criteria:

* design: are slides visual appealing? do graphics contribute to the message? is text large enough to read? is their a coherent style that ties the presentation together? does the aesthetic support the speaker's narrative?
* presentation style: how well does the speaker:
    - speak in a clear, loud voice. avoid "um", "like", etc
    - not read from slides (your design shouldn't have slides that require reading)
    - use eye contact, voice, and body language for emphasis and to engage the audience
    - _appear_ calm and well rehearsed
* reflection: take this opportunity to reflect on the role of games in your life. don't just tell us that you played Angry Birds instead of working on a homework assignment last year.
* organization: your presentation should tell a story, with a good beginning, middle, and end. you should use the presentation to tell us something about yourself, and about how you understand games.
* originality & creativity: this is not an academic presentation, try to make it light, creative, and fun.

Presentations must be uploaded to the course website prior to the beginning of class. They must be either .odp or .ppt files. Because they will auto-advance, PDF files cannot be accepted. Keynote users should create a PPT and make sure it looks right.

### Game response posts
Students need to actively understand the key elements that make up a genre. Most weeks in the course, there will be a play assignment. Students will be asked to play a game (either in the lab or online) and to post a short game response of 300 words to the course website. A good game response will closely analyze the game to make a point about one or more:

* why is it successful or not, as a game
* internally, what learning principles does the game employ to help players become more expert in the game system?
* how might it be used to teach?
* for better or worse, what cultural messages are encoded in the game?
* you should try to refer the readings for the week (and previous readings) in your discussion of the games

Each student will be responsible for **8 game responses** during the semester.

### Game pitch
The game pitch is a short description of your game concept that will _sell_ the idea. You do not need to have all of the details worked out for the pitch. Focus on the big ideas of your creative concept and the educational experience you are designing.

Things to keep in mind:

* how is the game used for learning
* the core features
* why is it engaging
* what learning principles it employs
* who is the audience (how/where/when will it be used)
* technical requirements and constraints
* feasibility of implementing your vision (if it require a team of 100 programmers and designers, breakthroughs in AI, and Hollywood actors for the talent &mdash; it is not very feasible)

You will have 10 minutes in class to present your pitch. Bring in anything you need to make a strong presentation: diagrams showing key interactions, art concepts that highlight the theme/aesthetics, screen shots or video from other games you draw upon, etc. You must post a 300 word pitch to the course website **prior to the class meeting**. After the pitches, you will choose which game you will work on developing during the semester. Students are strongly encouraged to work in pairs, but you may work on an individual design if you have the instructor's permission.

Game pitches will be evaluated by the class and the instructor.

### Blog comments
_(3 total)_

Much of the professional and academic conversation about games takes place online, with some high profile blogs garnering substantial attention from this community. For this assignment, you will participate in the games blogophere. Find an interesting and recent blog post or discussion topic related to video games. Read the post and any previous discussion, and then post an original comment of your own. Return to the site to monitor the discussion, follow-up with any subsequent comments as necessary.

You do not need to use your real name or identification for your post, and there are no qualifications for what you say (e.g. you do not need to express a particular point of view or refer to our class our readings). The only criteria for what you write is that you craft a thoughtful post.

During the course of the semester, you must post responses to 3 different blog posts in order to complete this assignment. The original post should be no more than 7 days old when you comment. In order to get credit for your blog comments, post a link to your comment on our course website.

You are not limited to these sites, but you may find them as good starting points for this assignment:

* [Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/)
* [Game studies](http://gamestudies.org/)
* [Grand Text Auto](http://grandtextauto.org/)
* [Ian Bogost's Blog](http://www.bogost.com/blog/)
* [Terranova](http://terranova.blogs.com/)
* [The Escapis](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/)

### Games & society debate
The class will be divided into two teams. One side will argue that games, as they exist today in our society, have a net harmful effect. This will be the **black team**. The black team may draw on the literature about games and violence, asocial behavior, negative stereotypes, etc. The other team, the **red team** will argue the opposite position: there is no reason to believe that games have a net negative effect on our culture.

Each team will prepare a 3 minute presentation:

1. opening statement
2. topics (1 topic for each team member)
3. closing statement

After the topic statements, the opposing team will have time for a 2 minute rebuttal.

### Game for learning analysis
You will choose a game to play extensively this semester (15+ hours), in order to evaluate the game for educational purposes. This analysis can take two forms. If the game can be readily implemented in the classroom, students can analyze what it can teach and what discussions can be used to focus learners. Students should consider when and how the game would be implemented.

For games that cannot be readily implemented—which might have to be re-designed or adjusted for the classroom—students should write about why the changes need to take place, and what the changes would be. Since not all teachers are game designers, and since games are expensive to produce, the goal of this paper is to let students think about how ready-made games can be used and adapted for different topics. (1600-2000 words)

Choose a game that you have extensive experience playing and analyze its structure and design in terms of its educational potential. Consider what the students can learn within the game that might translate to classroom learning goals. Indicate how the game could be used to integrate with other classroom projects and discussions. Describe when and how the game would be implemented.

Your essay should connect to course readings and, potentially, other articles that you find. You might want to consider Katie Salen’s 12 “Scenarios for Potential Uses of Gaming” (2011, pp 85-90) as a framework for thinking about how you would use your game to teach. When discussing why your game is useful for learning, it might help to refer to Jim Gee’s “36 Learning Principles”, in the appendix of _What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy_.

Your paper must be written as a formal, academic essay. Use the [APA format](http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=apa_exposed) for citations and other elements. The final paper must be between 1600-2000 words. Upload your assignment to the course website or share it with the instructor through Google Docs.

Acceptable file formats: .rtf, .html, .txt, .odt, .doc/x, .pdf
Unacceptable formats: .pages (Apple iWork), .wps (Microsoft Works), any other format not listed above

### Game design proposal
Kurt Squire describes endogenous games as games whose contexts and design are closely intertwined, as opposed to exogenous games, which serve as empty receptacles for bits of knowledge. We are all familiar with exogenous games. They are the trivia-type games that are popular on TV and in classrooms. They are popular in classrooms because they are easy to design and implement. However, they do not represent "good" games in the sense that they do not represent a meaningful ideological world.

Working individual or in teams of two, you will have the opportunity to design an original game for learning. Please not that _designing_ is not the same as developing or implementing the game. Even though we are designing digital/video games, you do not have to create a digital game.

Your **game proposal** must contain the following elements:

1. Title
2. Overview (200 words)
3. Learning goals & educational theory (500 words)
4. Research: a report on other similar games, games and studies that informed your decision (500 words)
5. Rules: the rules of you game_biography
6. Interface & artwork: to make your proposal more powerful, you should include sketches of key screens and interactions, you may (optionally) include drafts of designs and other artwork that contribute to the game aesthetics

In addition, you must come prepared to run a test of your game on the last day of class. This can be a paper test, but you need to bring everything that you need in order to try out the game.
