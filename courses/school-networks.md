**Description:** From a foundation of computer networks and systems, this
course expands to cover instructional technology infrastructure: file systems,
users, wired and wireless networks, email, web servers, computer labs, and
common educational software services. This course focuses on Free Software;
where the source code is free to use, study, or modify. Students will work
through a series of systems challenges, using their own (virtual) Linux
installation

**Keywords:** linux, bash, systems, networks, lamp, free software, trouble shooting, technical project management

GOALS & OBJECTIVES
------------------

The Educational Technology Specialist certification track must prepare
graduates to be school-based technology leaders. One of their main
duties will be to install and maintain local computer networks,
workstations, and school servers. Other graduates will be developing
networked learning solutions, requiring the fundamental knowledge and
skills covered in this course.

Students in this course develop a basic understanding of computer
operating systems and digital networks. Upon completing this course they
will be able to:

-   set up a secure, network computing environment
-   effectively use the basic tools of Unix/Linux computing environments
-   implement techniques for administering group and user permissions
-   install and troubleshoot hardware and software infrastructure for
    networked and internet computing
-   configure various server-side applications to support teaching and
    learning
-   identify the ethical and legal concerns surrounding school
    information systems

### Tues. 5/26: Computers and Operating Systems

In this session, students will set up their own installation of [Ubuntu
GNU/Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com) and will learn about the basic operations of
computer hardware and operating system software.

### Thurs 5/28: File System and Unix Basic

Students will learn about how information is stored on a computer, and learn
the basics of file permissions, backups, managing data, and working with linux
users and groups.

### Tues 6/2: Media Files

In this session students will learn the basic principles of representing and
working with digital images, audio, and video. They will learn the relative
advantages and uses of different media formats and codecs, and work with a
variety of tools for managing and working with media files.

### Thurs 6/4: Networks & Web Servers

During this session, students will be introduced to the principles of computer
networks, including the network protocols of the internet (IP/TCP, DNS, HTTP,
HTTPS). They will also install and configure the Apache HTTP Server to run
static web sites.

### Tues 6/9: Ethics & Security

Reviewing several cases of controversies in school systems, students
will consider the ethical and legal considerations of administering
computer systems in a school setting, including maintaining the privacy
of sensitive data, equitable distribution of computing resources, design
for universal access, and more.

In addition, they will gain proficiency and understanding of computer and
network security practices, protocols, and tools.

### Thurs 6/11: Midpoint Exam

This session will not meet in person. Students will individually complete a
timed exam on Moodle.

### Thurs 6/16: Database Servers

Students will gain a basic understanding of the uses and operations of
database servers. They will install MySql as well as the tools for managing
the database. They will be given a basic introduction to SQL, as well as the
tools for copying, backing-up, and moving databases.

### Thurs 6/18: Web Servers


### Thurs 6/23: Web Applications

During this session students will install and configure full web applications,
typically running on the Linux Apache MySQL PHP (LAMP) stack. Possible
applications include:

- Moodle
- WordPress
- Canvas
- MediaWiki
- edX


### Tues 6/25: Do-it-yourself

For our last class we will run a DIY fix-it workshop where students will
propose and complete their own projects.

Example project might include:

- jailbreaking an iPhone or rooting an Android device
- creating a dual boot linux laptop
- setting up an AWS server on Amazon for a public web application
- replacing the screen on a cracked phone
- backing up and re-installing Windows to remove viruses



Grades & Assignments
--------------------


Assignment       Pct      Due
---------------  ------   ----
Systems Game     40%      ongoing
Flash Cards      20%      6/7 (end of day on Sunday)
Midpoint Exam    30%      6/11
DIY Project      10%      6/25

### Systems Game

During the hands-on portion of each class meeting, students will be paired
with a random classmate. The class will be presented with a list of tasks
related to the topic, and each task will have an associated point value. Pairs
will work together to complete as many tasks as possible, earning points for
each task they complete. Pairs will receive the same number of points for the
session they work together. Points are cumulative for the duration of the
course, and the final grade will be calculated on the total points you earn.
The grade for this assignment will be on a curve, from A+ to B. If you miss
class you will not be able to earn points for that session.

### Flash Cards

Each student will be responsible for creating a deck of study flash cards to
be shared by everyone for the midpoint exam. Students must choose one of the
following topics:

1. Computer hardware
2. Operating Systems (and bootloaders)
3. Computer laws, privacy, and educational policies
4. File systems
5. Media files
6. Computer Networks (wired, wifi, cellular, etc)
7. Computer Security
8. Mobile computing (hardware, networks, software/OSs)

### Midpoint exam

The midpoint exam will be a multiple choice and short answer exam on the 8
topics listed above under "flashcards". Students will be responsible for
logging into Moodle to complete the timed exam individually. The exam will be
"open book", but students must not work together, share information regarding
the exam, or consult other people outside of the class for help during the
exam.

### DIY Project
Students will be given a grade for their DIY project:

- 3 points, risk/difficulty of the proposed project
- 3 points, achievement in completing their project
- 4 points, skill in approaching their project
