Course Communications
=====================

This is a _fully online course_. There is no set class time for video chat or
live lectures. However, there will be two live lab sessions each week held
by the instructors, using video conferencing, screen sharing, and other tools.
You will be required to attend at least 4 of these sessions.

Participants in this course must actively participate in our suite of online
communications tools, including Slack (<https://auedtech.slack.com>),
Adelphi email, and the course website.

You _must_ check your Adelphi email and the `#raspberrypi` channel on Slack **at least
once a day.** It is highly recommended that you install the Slack mobile client
and an email client on your mobile phone so that you receive "push notifications"
of course announcements.

The best place to post general course questions and any content-related questions
is the `#raspberrypi` Slack channel. The instructor and course assistant, as well
as other students and alums monitor this channel and often provide immediate support.
You are encouraged to contact the instructors at any time via email or direct
message on Slack.

**Online tools:**

- **Moodle:** will be used to post the syllabus and links to weekly readings, videos, and discussions.
- **Slack:** will be our main channel for online communications.
  Please [Join our Slack team with your Adelphi email](https://auedtech.slack.com/signup).
  If you run into trouble or have a question, post it here to our channel, `#raspberrypi`,
  or send a message to `@tomjennings`. During the weeks of the class, we recommend running
  the Slack app for you phone.
- **Trello:** is project management software that you will use to track/plan
  your two projects, and to share your progress with the course instructors.
  Create a [Trello Account](https://trello.com/signup) before the first week of
  class, and (optionally) [install the mobile app](https://trello.com/platforms).        
- **mail.adelphi.edu email:** we will use your official adelphi student email
  for class email communications as well as the associated google account for
  video/audio chats and calendar events. Please check this email regularly.

**Getting remote help:**

Because of the hands on nature of working with computers and Raspberry Pi, you
will have to use a variety of tools to get help. Your first stop for help should
be #raspberrypi on Slack. You are most likely to get quick help if you post here
because anyone in the channel (instructors, other students, other faculty, ed tech alums)
can lend a hand.

For more complicated problems, you will need to be able to:

- [post formatted code in slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages)
- [take a screenshot from your RPI](https://wiki.debian.org/ScreenShots#Using_Gnome)
- [create a google hangout/meeting with screensharing](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/7290345?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
- enable remote access to instructors to your RPI via `ssh` -- at the end of the
  first week, you should have `ssh` enabled on your Pi. To enable remote access
  you will probably have to [enable Network Address Translation on your wifi router]().
  If you are on public wifi (e.g. school, library, coffee shop), you probably won't
  be able to enable remote access. NAT is not hard to configure, but it's specific
  to the wifi router that you're using. You will have to search
  "configure network address translation" along with your router make and model.
- [connect to your RPI with VNC](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/)
  (once you're comfortable with NAT, you can also configure NAT for VNC if needed)


Required Books
==============
_None_

Required Materials
==================

Desktop/Laptop
--------------
You must have access to a desktop computer running Linux, Windows, or MacOS to
participate in this course. You will use this computer to participate in the
course online and to configure and connect or your RPI. You can use a phone
or tablet for some online elements of the course, however you will not be able
to complete course assignments without access to a computer where you are able
to install software.

In addition to the computer, you must have a webcam, headphones, and microphone
to participate in live video chat and to record your screencasts.

Raspberry Pi
------------

Every student _must_ purchase a Raspberry Pi (RPI) computer and accessories
for use in this course. You will keep your own hardware.

The core setup **required** for all students (~$50):

- Raspberry Pi model 3 B+ [Buy on Ada Fruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3775)
- 16GB Micro SD Card (at least 2 recommended)

_You must have your RPI **before** the first week of class._

In the spirit of Raspberry Pi and DIY, we encourage you to re-use any of these
items that you might already have or might be able to buy second hand. You
will need these items, but don't need to buy them new. If you are unsure, you
can wait until after the first class to make your purchase.

- USB Keyboard and Mouse
- Micro USB charger (you can use a phone charger)
- HDMI Cable
- Computer Monitor or TV with HDMI input (or you may need an HDMI to VGA adapter)
- USB Card reader for your MicroSD card

If you purchased everything except the monitor it would cost another $35-$50.

In addition to these core materials, you will also need to purchase/acquire
materials to complete your final project (see below).
Costs may range from $20-$80.

Participation
------------------
Because this is a short summer course (3 credits in 6 weeks), you should budget
10-15 hours each week for course work. You must join at least 4 of the live lab
sessions. During these labs, the course instructors will be available for help
with projects and will demonstrate over video and screensharing some of the key
techniques of the week. We recommend that you join at least one live lab each
week. Your participation grade will consider your participation in class, timely
management of your Trello projects, and participation in Slack and Moodle
discussions. Smaller weekly assignments (like the networking mini-report) will
inform your participation grade.

RPI Client or Server Setup
--------------------------
For our first project you will configure your Raspberry Pi for a specific
educational scenario: a general computer for 4th grade classroom computer
station, a setup to teach computer programming for kids, a development server
for the Canvas LMS, a web server to host static HTML/Javascript projects,
a managed computer lab setup, etc.

You will present your project as a narrated screencast. In addition to demonstrating the
software, you will upload a report which details:

- a description of the target audience and how you envision they would use the RPI
- the process you used to find, test, and configure the RPI
- key features of the software installed
- advantages, disadvantages, and other implications of your design

You will be evaluated on:

- demonstration of your understanding of RPI hardware and software
- suitability of your solution for your stated audience/problem
- risk/complexity of the task undertaken
- reflection on the process

_This is an individual project._

DIY Project
-----------
One of the key technical tasks of an educational technologist or instructional
designer is to research and evaluate possible solutions to a problem and then
implement a plan to test a possible solution. Real world problems often require
the combination of several systems in a new way, suffer from incomplete or
inaccurate documentation, and are hindered by time or resources/financial
constraints.

With this in mind, you will choose an RPI project that you find interesting and
engaging to pursue for your final project. You will be responsible for
gathering/purchasing the materials to complete the project.

You will be evaluated on:

- skill with RPI hardware
- skill with RPI software
- creativity of the project chosen
- risk/scope of the project
- reflection on the process

This is a _paired project._ You and a partner of your choice will work on the
same project. You will share a Trello and set goals together, however you will
both complete the project independently and will receive an individual grade.
Your partner will serve as a resource for planning and troubleshooting problems
that arise during the course of the project.

With the instructors' permission, you may work on this project individually.

While you are free to pursue your own project, you are welcome to choose a project
from this list:

1. **MyCroft Open Source personal assistant**<br>
   <https://mycroft.ai><br>
   MyCroft is a Free Software alternative to systems such as Alexa and Google Assistant.
   While it runs on a regular desktop computer, it was designed to work on a RPI.
   You can download a pre-configured SD Card image to get started with "PiCroft".
   For this project, you will download and configure MyCroft for your Pi; create
   and connect to your online account, configure and test the microphone and audio
   output, and customize the features and functionality of your RPI assistant.
   Start at the [mycroft site](https://mycroft.ai) for all of the information you need to get started.
2. **RetroPi Arcade Console**<br>
   <https://retropie.org.uk/><br>
   <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.hanahaki.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/arcade-bartop-raspberry-pi-retropie-mame-2018-diy-tutorial-guide.png?fit=735%2C458&ssl=1" alt="old school arcade games made with retropi" class="img-fluid d-block">
   Do you think that Fortnite has nothing on the original Streetfighter? That
   Assassin's Creed pales in the glow of Golden Eye? Or do you just want to play
   the Super Mario Bros, the greatest video game of all time? Turn your RPI into
   a video game emulator that can play the classics made for Artari, Nintendo NES, Sega,
   and more. Once you've got the general system up and running, you can add some
   custom controllers and make it an upright arcade.  
3. **Raspberry Pi Light Show**<br>
   <https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/christmas-lights/> & <https://opensource.com/life/15/2/music-light-show-with-raspberry-pi><br>
   <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Kci9K2E4fsvaqymZvO/giphy.gif" alt="very flash xmas light show" class="img-fluid d-block">
   Want to turn your classroom into a disco or put your neighbors to shame this
   Halloween or Christmas? Even if you don't, you should
   [check out this sick RPI Christmas display](https://youtu.be/90oZ52M4IC0).
4. **Mini Creature Home**<br>
   <https://allenheard.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/making-a-mini-beast-habitat-raspberry-pi-style/><br>
   Create an ant or snail home, complete with a live webcam. This project might should
   give you lots of ideas if your looking for STEAM projects for younger kids.
5. **MagicMirror**<br>
   <https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-best-raspberry-pi-smart-mirror-projects-weve-seen-far/><br>
   The magic mirror or smart mirror is an RPI favorite: put a reflective coating
   or 2-way mirrored plexiglass over an old monitor, hook it up to your Pi, and
   the possibilities abound.
6. **Digital (Pi)cture Frame**<br>
   <https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/showerthoughts-earthporn-make-inspiring-raspberry-pi-photo-frame/><br>
   If the _mirror_ seems like it might be too much, how about a digital picture frame?

4. After your Pi is up and running, the first thing you want to enable is a remote connection via `ssh`.
   [Follow this guide to enabling `ssh`](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/).

Week 2: The Command Line
------------------------
This week we will learn how to interact with our computer using the command line
(aka terminal). The command line interface (CLI) offers and alternative to the
graphical user interface (GUI) we are more familiar with. Wile the terminal
hearkens back to the early days of computing, its still very much alive for
systems administrators, software developers, and others. In particular, complex
tasks can be accomplished with a few lines of text, remote computers can be
easily accessed, and all manner of tasks can be automated (and scheduled).
Specifically, after gaining fluency with the command line, you will be able to
log into your RPI from your regular laptop or desktop computer in order to
configure and control it. To get started on the command line we'll check out
Terminus, a game developed at MIT to introduce the players to the command line.

In addition to jumping into the command line, by the end of the week you will
have customized your RPI by installing software packages through `apt` and the
GUI. You will also choose your topic for the first project and set up a Trello
with a Board for your project and milestones for each week until it's due.

4. Post in the FOSS Apps Discussion which apps you installed and a brief review of them.
5. Create a Trello Board for your project and invite the course instructors as
   collaborators.

Week 3: Users, Groups, Files, & Permissions
-------------------------------------------
As you're working on finishing up your first RPI project, we'll take a deeper
look at how files, permissions and security works on RPI and in linux/unix operating
systems generally. To better understand how to work with files, we'll take a look
at file archives (multiple files and directories combined in a single file) and
compression (reducing the size of a file). Because your programs all run as a
"user" (either root or their own user), it's important to understand files and
permissions to troubleshoot problems.

**Watch & Read:**
1. Watch [Files & File Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM) [12:02]

**To Do:**

- finish Project 1 by the end of the week

Week 4: Networks
----------------
How does the internet work? What happens after you hit enter on a search term
on [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/spread)? How does Spotify get music
to your phone to your wireless earbuds? A deeper understanding of different
networking hardware, software, and protocols will help us better understand
the networked software we're installing, configuring, and troubleshooting.

**Watch:**

1. [How the Internet Works in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc)[4:48]

**To Do:**

1. For a more in-depth look at a networking, you will work with a partner to write
   a mini report on related topics. Please: a) choose a partner, and b) choose a
   topic from the list below. If you have an idea for a different topic, you may
   write about that with approval from the instructors. By the end of the week,
   please post your report directly into our _Networking Topics_ forum. Your report
   should be roughly 500-800 words. It should give an overview of the topic,
   summary of how it works, and discussion of how it's used and why it is (or
   isn't) important. Read through the other posts, and ask any follow-up questions.
   The instructors and topic authors will do their best to answer your questions.

   Possible topics:

     1. Bluetooth
     2. Mesh network
     3. Near Field Communication (NFC)
     4. HTTPS/SSL
     5. 4g/5g/6g
     6. BitTorrent
     7. Dark Web
     8. Radio-frequency identification (RFID)
     9. Bluetooth Beacons

2. Choose a topic and a partner for your final project. Create a Trello board
   for it and share it with your partner and the instructors.


Week 5: Ethics
-------------------------------------
[As Spider-Man learned](https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/17610/spider-man_with_great_power._2008_1),
with great power comes great responsibility. We trust the people who run our
networks to keep our information safe, and to not violate our trust while they
do it. Along the way, they may face some hard choices, usually weighing the benefits
of individuals versus the group. We'll take a look at some of the ethical concerns
in "big tech", and also investigate how these same concerns appear in the context
of schools and other educational institutions.
