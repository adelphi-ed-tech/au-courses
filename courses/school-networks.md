**Description:** From a foundation of computer networks and systems, this course
expands to cover instructional technology infrastructure: file systems, users,
wired and wireless networks, email, web servers, computer labs, and common educational
software services. This course focuses on Free Software; where the source code
is free to use, study, or modify. To explore these topics in this hands on class
all students will be configuring their own Raspberry Pi computers and using them
to complete a software/hardware project.

**Keywords:** linux, bash, systems, networks, lamp, free software, trouble shooting,
technical project management, rasberry pi, physical computing, debian, ubuntu

Goals & Objectives
==================

This course introduces students to the key concepts in current networked
computing in order to develop a conceptual framework for configuring
and troubleshooting computing systems. Upon completing this course they
will be able to:

- set up a secure, network computing environment
- effectively use the basic tools of GNU/Linux computing environments
- implement techniques for administering group and user permissions
- install and troubleshoot hardware and software infrastructure for
  networked and internet computing
- configure a client/user computer for specific purposes
- configure various server-side applications to support teaching and
  learning
- identify the ethical and legal concerns surrounding educational
  information systems

Course Communications
=====================

This is a _fully online course_. There is no set class time for video chat or
live lectures. However, there will be two live lab sessions each week held
by the instructors, using video conferencing, screen sharing, and other tools.
You will be required to attend at least 4 of these sessions.

Participants in this course must actively participate in our suite of online
communications tools, including Slack (<https://auedtech.slack.com>),
Adelphi email, and the course website.

You _must_ check your Adelphi email and the `#raspberrypi` channel on Slack **at least
once a day.** It is highly recommended that you install the Slack mobile client
and an email client on your mobile phone so that you receive "push notifications"
of course announcements.

The best place to post general course questions and any content-related questions
is the `#raspberrypi` Slack channel. The instructor and course assistant, as well
as other students and alums monitor this channel and often provide immediate support.
You are encouraged to contact the instructors at any time via email or direct
message on Slack.

**Online tools:**
  ~ **Moodle:** will be used to post the syllabus and links to weekly readings, videos, and discussions.
  ~ **Slack:** will be our main channel for online communications.
    Please [Join our Slack team with your Adelphi email](https://auedtech.slack.com/signup).
    If you run into trouble or have a question, post it here to our channel, `#raspberrypi`,
    or send a message to `@tomjennings`. During the weeks of the class, we recommend running
    the Slack app for you phone.
  ~ **Trello:** is project management software that you will use to track/plan
    your two projects, and to share your progress with the course instructors.
    Create a [Trello Account](https://trello.com/signup) before the first week of
    class, and (optionally) [install the mobile app](https://trello.com/platforms).        
  ~ **mail.adelphi.edu email:** we will use your official adelphi student email
    for class email communications as well as the associated google account for
    video/audio chats and calendar events. Please check this email regularly.

Required Books
==============
_None_

Required Materials
==================

Desktop/Laptop
--------------
You must have access to a desktop computer running Linux, Windows, or MacOS to
participate in this course. You will use this computer to participate in the
course online and to configure and connect or your RPI. You can use a phone
or tablet for some online elements of the course, however you will not be able
to complete course assignments without access to a computer where you are able
to install software.

In addition to the computer, you must have a webcam, headphones, and microphone
to participate in live video chat and to record your screencasts.

Raspberry Pi
------------

Every student _must_ purchase a Raspberry Pi (RPI) computer and accessories
for use in this course. You will keep your own hardware.

The core setup **required** for all students (~$50):

- Raspberry Pi model 3 B+ [Buy on Ada Fruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3775)
- 16GB Micro SD Card (at least 2 recommended)

_You must have your RPI **before** the first week of class._

In the spirit of Raspberry Pi and DIY, we encourage you to re-use any of these
items that you might already have or might be able to buy second hand. You
will need these items, but don't need to buy them new. If you are unsure, you
can wait until after the first class to make your purchase.

- USB Keyboard and Mouse
- Micro USB charger (you can use a phone charger)
- HDMI Cable
- Computer Monitor or TV with HDMI input (or you may need an HDMI to VGA adapter)
- USB Card reader for your MicroSD card

If you purchased everything except the monitor it would cost another $35-$50.

In addition to these core materials, you will also need to purchase/acquire
materials to complete your final project (see below).
Costs may range from $20-$80.

Participation
------------------
Because this is a short summer course (3 credits in 6 weeks), you should budget
10-15 hours each week for course work. You must join at least 4 of the live lab
sessions. During these labs, the course instructors will be available for help
with projects and will demonstrate over video and screensharing some of the key
techniques of the week. We recommend that you join at least one live lab each
week. Your participation grade will consider your participation in class, timely
management of your Trello projects, and participation in Slack and Moodle
discussions.

RPI Client or Server Setup
--------------------------
For our first project you will configure your Raspberry Pi for a specific
educational scenario: a general computer for 4th grade classroom computer
station, a setup to teach computer programming for kids, a development server
for the Canvas LMS, a web server to host static HTML/Javascript projects,
a managed computer lab setup, etc.

You will present your project as a narrated screencast. In addition to demonstrating the
software, you will upload a report which details:

- a description of the target audience and how you envision they would use the RPI
- the process you used to find, test, and configure the RPI
- key features of the software installed
- advantages, disadvantages, and other implications of your design

You will be evaluated on:

- demonstration of your understanding of RPI hardware and software
- suitability of your solution for your stated audience/problem
- risk/complexity of the task undertaken
- reflection on the process

This is an individual project.

DIY Project
-----------
One of the key technical tasks of an educational technologist or instructional
designer is to research and evaluate possible solutions to a problem and then
implement a plan to test a possible solution. Real world problems often require
the combination of several systems in a new way, suffer from incomplete or
inaccurate documentation, and are hindered by time or resources/financial
constraints.

With this in mind, you will choose an RPI project that you find interesting and
engaging to pursue for your final project. You will be responsible for
gathering/purchasing the materials to complete the project.

You will be evaluated on:

- skill with RPI hardware
- skill with RPI software
- creativity of the project chosen
- risk/scope of the project
- reflection on the process

This is a _paired project._ You and a partner of your choice will work on the
same project. You will share a Trello and set goals together, however you will
both complete the project independently and will receive an individual grade.
Your partner will serve as a resource for planning and troubleshooting problems
that arise during the course of the project.

With the instructors' permission, you may work on this project individually.

Weekly Sessions

Week 1: Computers & Operating Systems
-------------------------------------
This week we will learn about core computer hardware, and the key software
(Operating Systems) that drive computers. We'll also learn about the specific
hardware of our RPIs and install an operating system so we can take them out
for a test drive.
