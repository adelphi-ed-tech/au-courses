**Description:** From a foundation of computer networks and systems, this
course expands to cover instructional technology infrastructure: file systems,
users, wired and wireless networks, email, web servers, computer labs, and
common educational software services. This course focuses on Free Software;
where the source code is free to use, study, or modify. To explore these topics
in this hands on class all students will be configuring their own Raspberry Pi
computers and using them to complete a software/hardware project.

**Keywords:** linux, bash, systems, networks, lamp, free software, trouble shooting, technical project management, rasberry pi, physical computing, debian, ubuntu

GOALS & OBJECTIVES
------------------

This course introduces students to the key concepts in current networked
computing in order to develop a conceptual framework for configuring
and troubleshooting computing systems. Upon completing this course they
will be able to:

- set up a secure, network computing environment
- effectively use the basic tools of Unix/Linux computing environments
- implement techniques for administering group and user permissions
- install and troubleshoot hardware and software infrastructure for
  networked and internet computing
- configure and client/user computers for specific purposes
- configure various server-side applications to support teaching and
  learning
- identify the ethical and legal concerns surrounding educational
  information systems


Required Books
--------------
_None_

Required Materials
------------------

Every student _must_ purchase a Rasberry Pi computer and accessories
for use in this course. They will keep their own hardware.

The core setup **required** for all students (~$50):

- Raspberry Pi model 2
- 16GB Micro SD Card (2 recommended)

_You must bring your Raspberry Pi and SD Card to our first class meeting._

--------------------------------------------------------

In the spirit of Raspberry Pi and DIY, we encourage you to re-use any of these
items that you might already have or might be able to buy second hand. You
will need these items, but don't need to buy them new. If you are unsure, you
can wait until after the first class to make your purchase.

- USB Keyboard and Mouse
- Micro USB charger (you can use a phone charger)
- HDMI Cable
- Computer Monitor or TV with HDMI input (or you may need an HDMI to VGA adapter)
- USB Card reader for your MicroSD card

If you purchased everything except the monitor it would cost another $35-$50.

In addition to these core materials, you will also need to purchase/acquire materials to complete your final project ([see assignments](#assignments)). Costs may range from $20-$50.

### Participation

Because this is a short summer course (3 credits in 5 weeks), we expect
everyone to make every effort to attend every class meeting. If you cannot
make it to class in-person, you will be able to join us via our FlexEd video
conferencing. Because of the hands-on nature of the course, we recommend
that you make your best effort to attend at least one weekly session in person.
Your participation grade will be based on your ability to work in group projects,
positive attitude in class, and preparedness for class meetings.

### RPI Client or Server Setup

For this mid-point project you will configure your Raspberry Pi for a specific
educational scenario: a general computer for 4th grade classroom computer
station, a setup to teach computer programming for kids, a development server
for the Canvas LMS, a managed computer lab setup, etc.

Your report must include:

- the audience for the 


### DIY Project
Students will be given a grade for their DIY project:

- 3 points, risk/difficulty of the proposed project
- 3 points, achievement in completing their project
- 4 points, skill in approaching their project
