**Computer Science 0145-602, Fall 2016**

**Keywords:**  computer programming, CS1, javascript, computational thinking, critical computational literacy

**Description:** This course introduces students to programming and 
some core concepts of computer science, using a modern, object oriented
programming language. Students learn concepts of 
variables, functions, repetition/loops, basic data structures 
(arrays, lists, hashtables), and basic object oriented programming.

Learning Goals
==============

* understand the types of problems that can be solved using computational techniques
* understand the basic concepts of computation (CPU, RAM, permanent storage, GUIs, file systems, network connections) 
* learn core computer programming concepts (abstraction, variables, conditions, functions, repetition, recursion) 
* think algorithmically to design and test computer programs 
* master the basic syntax and idioms of the Javascript programming language 
* use technical documentation, APIs, and the internet to learn new technical concepts 
* develop step-by-step problem solving and debugging practices

Assignments and Grading
=======================

Assignment              Pct   Due date
-------------------     ----  --------
Single Page Site        30%   Sep 13
Slideshow               30%   Oct 18
Web appplication        40%   Dec 19


Single Page Website (30%)
-------------------------

Students will build a single-page,
informational website on a topic of their choice. Their website
will be composed of HTML, CSS, and (optionally) Javascript. It
will display their fluency with the HTML elements, styling
with CSS, and enhancing user experience with Javascript. The
content of the website is entirely up to the student. They are
encouraged to create a website on something they are already
familiar with and interested in. This is an individual project.

Photo slideshow (30%)
--------------------------------

For this second project students will be asked to re-imagine a common web
application--the photo/media slideshow. Students will study existing solutions
and then develop and implement their own design. The task will be simplified
because this will be a client-side only application. We will not develop
components to upload photos, merely to play a set of photos on our website. In
this individual project students will work through key programming concepts,
including writing their own GUI, custom JS functions, and standard and custom
data structures.

Web appplication (40%)
-----------------------------

Using Javascript, HTML, and CSS students will design and develop an
interactive web application. For this project, students will go through the
full design process. These apps will enable users to store and modify data
through a range of interface elements. The code will demonstrate their
understanding of core programming and computer science concepts. Unlike the
first two projects, this will be a group project.
