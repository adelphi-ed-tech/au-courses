Technology Requirements
==========================================================================================

Everyone will need access to a Python development environment at home in order to complete
the homework and project assignments. We will be using the following core tools:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/): the python language, you may have an earlier version installed (e.g. Python 2.7), but you will need Python 3 (Python 3.3, 3.4, etc) for this course
    * you should be able to execute python scripts and the python interpreter from a command prompt
- [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3): This is a programmer's text editor and we will use it to write our Python programs
- [Slack](https://auedtech.slack.com): team communication/chat software that we will use to ask and answer questions when we get stuck, this is also the preferred way to contact me with course related questions. For private concerns, you can email me. You will have to [register on our slack team using your adelphi email](https://auedtech.slack.com). There are Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android clients, as well as the web client.
- (optional) [iPython](http://ipython.org/install.html): a better interactive python shell

Class meetings
==========================================================================================

All students are expected to come on time and prepared for class. You may
bring your own laptop to class, or use one of the lab computers for your work.
If you need source files to work on in class, you are responsible for bringing
them or making them available online. It is recommended that you bring a USB
flash drive or set-up Google Drive or Dropbox to manage your files for this
course.

Assignments and Grading
==========================================================================================

Assignment              Pct
-------------------     -------
Quizzes                 30%
Midterm                 30%
Final Project           40%

Quizzes
--------------------------------------------------------

There will be 10 pass/fail quizzes which will be completed 
individually at the start of class. Quizzes consist of 1-5 short 
answer programming questions drawn directly from the reading for the 
week. Quizzes are designed to be passed easily by students who are 
keeping up with the reading and the concepts in the course, and will 
help students and the instructor maintain a good pace for the 
development of the course.

Midterm
--------------------------------------------------------

There will be an in-class midterm for this course on session 8. The midterm will require most/all of the available class time. The exam will consist of a short answer section as well as a full program which will likely require several functions to solve. There will be no partial credit for short answers. The full program will be scored with partial credit. Students will choose from one of two possible problems for the long-answer. The exam will be "open book"—students can use their notes, online resources, the course text, code examples from class, etc. The only exception is that real-time communication between students, or between students and outside parties is prohibited during the exam (i.e. no Slack, IM, texting, IRC, posting new questions to forums, etc).

Final Project: Textual Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------

For this project you will select a text or a collection of texts and write a
program that uses computation to analyze the texts. It is up to you to both
select the texts and to decide what type of analysis is "interesting."

You should demonstrate the following in your code:

#### Marking guide:

There are a total of 20 possible points for this assignment, which will
be evaluated on the following criteria:

1. **Question Quality** (_3 points_)\
   Does the question chosen reflect a problem that a computer program is good
   at analyzing? Is the question interesting or important? Is the answer
   obvious, or is it worthy of analysis?

    - 3 points: the _question can not be easily answered without the aid of
      software_ because it analyzes a large data set, involves 
      tedious/repetitive tasks which are prone to error, or requires complex
      calculations. Further, the _question is interesting_—it tells us
      something that is not already established in research or provides
      evidence for something that is incompletely or ambiguously understood
    - 2 points: the question meets one of the two criteria for 3 points,
      but not both
    - 1 point: the question is trivial or obvious after brief human
      analysis, or does not lend itself to generalization/abstract
      conclusions
    - 0 points: the question would be more easily analyzed by human
      rather than computer analysis; trying to write software to
      answer the problem actually makes it more difficult to get a clear
      picture of the problem
2. **Coding fundamentals** (_8 points_)\
   The program demonstrates a grasp of the programming concepts covered
   in this class, including:

    - _variables_
        - data is not "hard coded" and can be easily changed
        by using variables
        - data is separate from functionality
    - _functions_
        - abstraction through function parameters
        - encapsulation through function parameters and return statements; 
          use "pure functions" with zero-side effects
    - _design_
        - the program is organized through the use of functions
        - functions "scale" is appropriate to the task and discrete:
          concerns are separated logically, such as one function
          for gather results and another for displaying results
        - functions are written in a way that they are used
          several times in the program
        - code is not repeated
    - _data structures_
        - use python built-in data structures appropriately:
          ``list``, ``dict``, ``tuple``, ``set``
        - use index/slice notation if needed
        - sort data structures
   
    _Point values:_

    - 6-8 points: creates new functions that perform _new analysis_ not
      available in the ``content.py`` program provided by the instructor. The
      program would easily be able to work on a different data set 
      (i.e. different input text files) to provide good results. Functions
      are consistent (in that the parameters expected and results
      returned work well with other functions in the program) and can be
      combined in different ways.
    - 3-5 points: code is clear and organized, but does not add significant
      new functions, some code may have unintended side effects, such
      as modifying list or dictionary data in unexpected ways; other code
      may take parameters, but not use them. Code cannot easily operate
      on other data sets.
    - 0-2 points: repetitive tasks are not factored into functions, but
      exhibit more of a copy-paste approach, functions don't (always)
      return the expected results or contain logic errors; code doesn't
      run due to syntax errors or runtime errors
3. **Risk Taking** (_4 points_)\
   How "adventurous" is this code? Does the student show that they move beyond the
   template given to them? Is there evidence they read online docs or the course text to learn
   addition techniques to approach the problem?

     - 4 points: in several places, the program use advanced features such 
       as optional functional parameters, list comprehensions,
       advanced sorting techniques, object oriented programming, or string formatting functions; libraries
       are imported to improve code performance and clarity; content.py
       functions are modified and improved by the student
    -  3 points: some core changes are made to content.py, other advanced
       techniques are evident 1 or 2 times
    -  1-2 points: tentative changes are made to content.py, mostly by
       adding composite functions that combine existing functionality
    -  0 points: only cosmetic changes are made to the initial content.py
       example, such as changing the input text files and the target
       words passed into the ``neighbors`` function
4. **Code Style** (_2 points_)\
   Is the program consistently formatted according to Python conventions?

    - 2 points: consistently follows the spirit of the _Think Python_ and
      PEP 8 style guides.
    - 1 point: follows guide most of the time, shows internal consistency
       for style
    - 0 points: lack of consistency in style makes the program harder to
      read and (potentially) harder to debug and maintain

5. **Results** (_3 points_)\
   The quality of your results include both the information that your program
   produces and the way that it is formatted for the user. When your program
   runs, it should produce some type of report that sheds light on your
   hypothesis. It doesn't matter if your hypothesis was correct or not—after
   your program runs, the user should have more information to evaluate the
   hypothesis. 

       - 3 points: results give clear support for or against the
         hypothesis by providing relevant information and are formatted
         in a way that makes them easy to interpret
       - 2 points: results provide some evidence for or against the
         hypothesis. they may not be formatted in a way that makes them
         easy to interpret or they may leave some ambiguity that could
         have been explored further in the code
       - 1 point: some evidence is provided but it is difficult to 
         interpret either due to formatting or the output achieved
       - 0 points: results do not shed any light on the question posed

#### Deliverables:

You should turn in all files related to your project in a single
archive (e.g., .zip, .tar, .7z). Project files _must_ contain your
**Python program** and the data/text files you're analyzing. 
The program must start with a comment where you identify:

* the question you are investigating (i.e. your hypothesis)
* the method for investigating this question
* the results identified by your code

To create an archive file, Mac users can simply right-click
the project folder from the finder and choose "Compress". This
will create a .zip archive of the project directory. Windows
does not come with a compression utility by default. If you
do not have one installed or are not sure, Adelphi IT
recommends [7-zip, which you can download and use for free.](http://7-zip.org/)

Here is an example header comment:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.python}
# news.py
# by: matt curinga
"""
Background:
New York has 3 major daily newspapers:
The New York Times, The Daily News, and The New York Post.

It is commonly understood that the Times is written at
higher level than the other dailies.

Hypothesis:
Computational analysis of articles will show that
the Times is written at a higher level than the
other two papers.

Method:
This program looks at four measures to compare
the papers:

1. Average sentence length
2. Average word length
3. Word diversity (unique words per 1k words)
4. Average word frequency (computed against unique word frequency table)

Results:
The results of this program support the hypothesis in all
four measures. The Times had longer sentences, longer
words, greater word diversity, and lower frequency
words.
"""

#### Text Resources
Here are a few links to places online where you can find full texts to download.
This list is by no means exhaustive, but with these links you can certainly
find a suitable text for your project. If you are looking for something more
specific, or want to work with a text that is not in the public domain
or released under a permissive copyright license, please contact the course
instructor.

* [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) (out of copyright books, other stuff)\
  Project Gutenberg has a very large collection of texts, mostly classic works
  including novels, poetry, history, philosophy, etc. You can choose to download the
  texts as a text file (UTF-8 or ASCII). You probably want to delete the Project Gutenberg
  license and pre-amble stuff before you begin your analysis.
* [Nexis-Lexis](http://libproxy.adelphi.edu:2048/login?url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?)\
  Lexis-Nexis is a database of newspaper (and other news) articles, which affords a range
  of search parameters. You can export the full text articles for more recent articles 
  (published in the last 20 years or so). You will probably have to download
  your articles in batches and copy-past them into one file for your analysis.
  _You must log in to Adelphi follow this link_.
* [JSTOR](http://libproxy.adelphi.edu:2048/login?url=http://www.jstor.org/cgi-bin/jstor/gensearch)\
  JSTOR allows you to search a range of academic journal articles. You cannot
  easily export the full text of the articles in one shot, but you can export
  the titles and abstracts, which is often enough for interesting analysis.
  Like Lexis-Nexis, _you must log in to Adelphi to follow the link_.
  **Tips:** 
  - use the basic search, which allows you to export abstracts and 
    titles
  - change the options to show 100 results at a time
  - use the "select all" toggle to select the full page of results
  - choose "Printer-friendly" as the export format
  - copy-paste those results into one file
  - repeat for next batch of 100 results 
* [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/rr/)\
  The Library of Congress maintains a decent online
  collection of materials, including the text of historical
  documents and more.
* [WikiSource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page)
  WikiSource contains the full text of documents on Wikipedia and elsewhere
  there is a lot of overlap with Gutenberg, but it might be easier to find
  and access the WikiSource documents.
* [American Rhetoric Speech Bank](http://americanrhetoric.com/speechbank.htm)
  I can't vouch for this source in particular, but they do have a collection
  of famous speeches. Many/most of these are in the public domain, but this
  might be a decent place to look for them, if you want to analyze speeches.


#### Sample project ideas

One of the intentional challenges of this project is for students to generate
their own ideas for projects. It's one thing to answer a quiz question or
to work on homework problems where you know exactly what you are supposed
to do; quite another when you need to decide what the goals for the
program are, too, and what results it should find.

Here are some ideas, though, that might get you started.

1. Compare the ways that U.S. news and foreign news cover a topic:
    a. choose your topic
    b. download US news with a keyword search
    c. download foreign news with same keywords
    d. do a neighbor (n-gram) analysis of word counts near key terms
2. [Stylometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry)\
   Instead of considering the context and content of important keywords,
   stylometry would let us look at the style of a text. By considering
   common words and phrases, we might be able to answer questions such
   as:
   a. is a text written by a man or a woman?
   b. do African Americans have a distinct writing style?
   c. how has writing style changed over time? can we identify when
      a piece was written based on its style?
3. Compare 2 books or 2 authors\
   Create two texts from Gutenberg or another source and pick an area
   to analyze. Classic things to consider are the ways a text deals
   with issues of race, gender, sex, violence, humor, death, god/religion,
   etc.
4. Compare speeches:
   - what are the difference and similarities between speeches
     from WWI, WWII, Vietnam, and today? Has the "security" message changed?
     Has the anti-war/peace message changed?
   - compare the speeches from different political parties? what propaganda
     do they use? how do they use language to shade the issues that are
     most crucial to their supporters?
   - what are the characteristics of a great speech? are the similarities
     between the rhetorical styles of Lincoln, Churchill, King, Malcom X
     and others?
