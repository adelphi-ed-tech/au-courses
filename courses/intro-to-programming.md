Learning Goals
==============

* understand the types of problems that can be solved using computational techniques
* understand the basic concepts of computation (CPU, RAM, permanent storage, GUIs, file systems, network connections) 
* learn core computer programming concepts (abstraction, variables, conditions, functions, repetition, recursion) 
* think algorithmically to design and test computer programs 
* master the basic syntax and idioms of the Javascript programming language 
* use technical documentation, APIs, and the internet to learn new technical concepts 
* develop step-by-step problem solving and debugging practices

Assignments and Grading
=======================

Assignment              Pct   Due date
-------------------     ----  --------
Single Page Site        30%   Sep 13
Web app                 30%   Oct 18
Multimedia work         40%   Dec 19


Single Page Website (30%)
-------------------------

Students will build a single-page,
informational website on a topic of their choice. Their website
will be composed of HTML, CSS, and (optionally) Javascript. It
will display their fluency with the HTML elements, styling
with CSS, and enhancing user experience with Javascript. The
content of the website is entirely up to the student. They are
encouraged to create a website on something they are already
familiar with and interested in. This is an individual project.

Interactive web application (35%)
----------------------------------------

Using Javascript, HTML, and CSS students will design and develop an
interactive website. For this project, students will go through the full
design process. Their code will demonstrate their understanding
of core programming and computer science concepts.

Multimedia presentation (35%)
-----------------------------

For the final project students will continue to develop their programming
skills while turning their efforts towards more artistic and creative work.
This project will combine audio, video, animation etc. Unlike the first two
projects, this will be a group project.
