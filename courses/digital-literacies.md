**Educational Technology 0858-501, Summer Institute Edition '14**

**Key words:** digital literacies, multileracies, new literacy, semantics, new media, communication
theory, youth media, media studies, software studies

Description
====================
How do multimedia, texting, chat, status updates, and hypertext change the way we read and interpret texts? Students study various theories of literacy and how it changes with the introduction of digital technologies. Readings will include selections on new media, new literacy, multiliteracies, multimedia cognition, and visual semantics.

This foundational course provides students a conceptual framework to critically interpret digital media, and to author powerful and effective digital documents. Students have the opportunity to practice and develop these skills, which are central to many aspects of the degree in Educational Technology.

Goals & objectives
====================

Two overarching goals drive this course. First, students should
understand the literacy skills required to critically interpret digital
texts. Second, they should learn how to communicate effectively using
the tools and techniques of digital media. More specifically:

* Students will develop a conception of "digital literacy" as a multifaceted, social process of
  decoding audio and visual symbols and signals.
* Students will gain a familiarity with a range of research perspectives which engage with digital
  literacy. 
* Students will refine their understanding of the affordances of a range of media, and these
  features' implications for literacy.
* Students will confront and assess their own preconceived ideas about literacy and technology
  skills and how learners acquire them.
* Students will be able to create a variety of digital texts to communicate in different genres and
  for multiple purposes. 
* Students will be able to articulate the cultural and political implications of communication, with
  attention to concerns of power and equity online and in classrooms.

Assignments
===========

Digital portfolio
------------------------------
You will create a digital portfolio that highlights your understanding and proficiency with various digital literacies. You will be adding items to this portfolio throughout the course. You _must_ show a breadth of expertise, with basic proficiency in each area of digital literacy. You will host your digital portfolio on your Adelphi ``panther`` account.


### Item 1: HTML/Hypertext

HTML is the basic building block of the Web and the most pervasive form of hypertext in use today. While most HTML is generated dynamically by web-based programming languages and/or GUI editors, understanding how to _hand code_ html is an important piece of digital literacy for both consumers and producers of digital texts. Your portfolio will contain a home page, your resume/CV, and links to all of the other components of the portfolio identified below.

### Item 2: Digital Images

We live in a visual culture, and the ability to communicate using images is essential. The verb, "to photoshop" something has become common place in our society. Everyone's portfolio must contain a **collage** where they exhibit their skills in digital image editing: cropping, scaling, selecting, composting, using layers, combining text and images. In addition to these _technical_ requirements, your collage must also strive for expressive content, common in our study of new media: playfulness, non-linearity and multiplicity, irony/paradox, etc.

### Item 3: Digital Video and Audio

[100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute](http://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics/). Online video for teaching and learning have exploded, popularized by sites like [TED](http://ted.com) and [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) and video lectures in MOOCs. Your portfolio must include a 60 second video, where you teach _something_. The video can be made with footage that you shoot (with your phone, tablet, etc), find online and remix, create from still images, or "screencast" on your computer. Upload your video to YouTube and embed it in your portfolio.

### Item 4: Privacy & Security

Your portfolio must include a report of a **personal security audit**. Your audit will examine your digital and social practices to look for weaknesses. You must consider:
    
1. what **digital data** is most precious to you? do you have back-ups? how are they managed? can you restore them? if you keep your data "in the cloud", can you retrieve it all at once? can you keep your own backup? _do you_? are you locked into a certain service (e.g. flickr, facebook, gmail)? are you locked into a proprietary format that would prevent you from switching? are their social/network pressures that influence you?
2. **financial security.** How do you choose passwords? How strong are they? Do you share them? Do you use them across multiple sites? What would happen if one of your passwords and email were stolen from a site you belong to? Can you list all of the sites/services that have financial information (e.g. CC, bank account, SSN)? In order, which of these do you think are the most secure?
3. **personal digital security.** Do you run a firewall on your desktop or laptop computer? Is there a password on your phone or tablet? If I stole your phone, what would I find? Do you encrypt any files on your computer? If I logged into your computer (or networked account) as you, what damage could I do? What steps do you take to minimize this damage?
4. **social security.** If I Google your name, what do I see? Would you want your mom to see it? Your (potential) boss? Do the top hits give the image you want to project? What if I look on Bing, Yahoo, or Duck Duck Go?\
What about Facebook or that old MySpace account? How much information is public, or shared with your "networks" (i.e. everyone on Facebook)? What is the worst case if your FB account were hacked? What if you have a falling out with a close friend or lover? If you were hoping for a job at the Mayor's office and they asked to see your personal FB account, would you still get the job? Do you care?

Write up your finding, (self) recommendations, and any changes that you have already made in a one-page report (~300 words).

### Item 5: Data literacy

The networked society is characterized by the problem of overabundance rather than scarcity of information. This means you must be able to to gather, analyze, and communicate large amounts of data. While not all of this information is quantitative, this portfolio item focuses on quantitative analysis. You will demonstrate your data literacy skills by:

1. Finding and downloading an interesting (and sufficiently large) data set.
2. Analyzing it using spreadsheet software.
3. Discovering something interesting in the data.
4. Creating a multimedia (textual and visual) representation of your interesting finding (like a series of graphs or an infographic).


Seminar Leader
---------------

Each student will lead the discussion part of our class, where they spend extra time preparing to discuss the readings and devise strategies and prompts to facilitate a good discussion. The leader will not create a presentation, but will be an active participant in the seminar discussion. Discussions will typically take one of our class time.

Participation
--------------

Your participation in the class is crucial for the class to succeed for all of us. You are expected to attend every class meeting and to arrive on time. You should treat your peers professionally and with respect. You should come to class prepared to discuss readings and other work. Lastly, you should turn in all assignments in a timely manner.

Web & Digital Media Toolbox and Resources
=========================================

Software & Tools
-----------------
The first step in becoming a web developer is to get your computer
set up to start writing code and testing it out. At the very least
you will need a ``text editor`` and a ``web browser``. I'm guessing
you have a web browser already.

This short, curated list is the software we will be using.

* Text Editor
    - [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (free trial, Mac, Win, Linux)
* Browser
    - [Firefox](http://www.firefox.com), our go-to browser, better with [the firebug extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/)
    - [Safari](http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1531), to get a second look
    - [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/), to test you site in Chrome
    - [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie), you might as well take a look in IE, too, either on your old windows box or in emulation
* Source control
    - [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* FTP/SFTP/SCP Clients
    - [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client), cross platform
    - [CyberDuck](http://cyberduck.io/), mac
    - [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php), windows
* Windows stuff
    - [PuTTy](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/), ssh client
    - [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), create a GNU/linux-like terminal on Windows.
      This is a big install, but worth it if you are going to stick with windows
* Linux
    - Linux is a great platform for programmers and web developers
    - many of the software is written/test on linux
    - many guides assume linux
    - your public website, eventually, will run on linux (in all likeliness)
    - so, check out [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and maybe give it
      a shot, especially if you have a Windows laptop
* Virtualization
    - want to try linux but can't commit?
    - want to install IE but hate Windows?
    - give [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) a shot
* Media editing
    - [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) for photo editing and raster images (instead of photoshop)
    - [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) for vector graphics (like SVGs)
    - [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) for editing and creating audio files
    - [LibreOffice Draw](http://www.libreoffice.org/features/draw/) is great for creating charts and diagrams, good for flowcharting and wireframes of software/sites you're working on
    - Color picker: a tool to find the hex or RGB code for colors on your desktop
        - OSX (built-in): [DigitalColor Meter](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/discover-the-digitalcolor-meter-tool-on-your-mac/)
        - Win: [List of Eyedropper](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/eyedroppers-color-pickers-for-designers/ "any one of the Windows ones should work")
