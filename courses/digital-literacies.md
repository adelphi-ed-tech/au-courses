**Educational Technology 0858-501, Fall 2016**

**Key words:** digital literacies, multileracies, new literacy, semantics, new media, communication
theory, youth media, media studies, software studies

Description
====================
How do multimedia, texting, chat, status updates, and hypertext change the way we read and interpret texts? Students study various theories of literacy and how it changes with the introduction of digital technologies. Readings will include selections on new media, new literacy, multiliteracies, multimedia cognition, and visual semantics.

This foundational course provides students a conceptual framework to critically interpret digital media, and to author powerful and effective digital documents. Students have the opportunity to practice and develop these skills, which are central to many aspects of the degree in Educational Technology.

Class Information
====================
**Instructor:**

- [Matthew X. Curinga](http://matt.curinga.com), <mcuringa@adelphi.edu>

**Class dates:** Monday, Aug 29 - Sunday, Dec 18

**Class meetings:**


This is an [_asynchronous_ online class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_learning), which will run on a weekly schedule, Monday-Sunday, beginning Monday, August 29. In asynchronous classes, there is no set time where the whole class "meets" online (e.g., via video chat). This does not mean that you will be working alone, or studying at your own pace. Each week, there will be short deadlines to post to the course websites and complete other assignments; many of these will be group assignments.  You **must** commit to checking the online course materials (email, Moodle, Slack, & other communications) every day during the course. For us to be able to study together, it is crucial that everyone respect deadlines and submit their work on time.

**Office hours:**

- Tuesday 3pm-5pm, Manhattan Center
- Thursday 12-2pm, online
- _office hours by appointment_

Goals & objectives
====================

Two overarching goals drive this course. First, students should
understand the literacy skills required to critically interpret digital
texts. Second, they should learn how to communicate effectively using
the tools and techniques of digital media. More specifically:

* Students will develop a conception of "digital literacy" as a multifaceted, social process of
  decoding tex, audio, and visual symbols and signals.
* Students will gain a familiarity with a range of research perspectives which engage with digital
  literacy.
* Students will refine their understanding of the affordances of a range of media, and these
  features' implications for literacy.
* Students will confront and assess their own preconceived ideas about literacy and technology
  skills and how learners acquire them.
* Students will be able to create a variety of digital texts to communicate in different genres and
  for multiple purposes.
* Students will be able to articulate the cultural and political implications of communication, with
  attention to concerns of power and equity online and in classrooms.

Assignments
===========

Digital portfolio
------------------------------

### Item 1: Web Portfolio

For this course you will be setting up and creating your own website that will 
showcase you work in this class. You will use the hosted [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) content management system for your site. Your portfolio will be assessed on its logical structure/organization, its usability, and its use of design and other digital media elements to enhance its appeal and message. In short, your portfolio should demonstrate your mastery of the specific tools made available by Wordpress, and of the general techniques of expressing ideas through a multimedia website.

### Item 2: Digital Collage

We live in a visual culture, and the ability to communicate using images is essential. The verb, "to photoshop" something has become common place in our society. You will create a **collage** where you exhibit your skills in digital image editing: cropping, scaling, selecting, composting, using layers, combining text and images. In addition to these _technical_ requirements, your collage must also strive for expressive content, common in our study of new media: playfulness, non-linearity and multiplicity, irony/paradox, etc. You are free to choose the subject and style of your collage.

### Item 3: Youth Media Video Critique

This is a group project. All group members will receive the same grade. Working with your group, you will produce one video critique of a youth media topic.

The main _point_ of the video is to practice and display your critical media analysis skills. To do so, though, you will also need to produce a high quality amateur video.

Technically, your video must have:

- clips from each person on your team (either voice over or on-screen)
- still images or video clips to illustrate your points
- multiple cuts with simple transitions (e.g. fades)
- an opening title screen with text


### Item 4: Media analysis
While we will be writing short reading response posts on most weeks, during this course you will also write a more formal paper where you analyze a piece of digital media, using the frameworks discussed in our readings. The paper must ~1,000 words in length. For this paper we will practice peer editing and the drafting/revising process that is essential to writing high quality scholarly work. You should select a new media work (website, software/app, film, tv show, etc) and offer an original analysis of it. To complete your analysis you should refer to the various analytic frameworks we have studied in this course. Your analysis is not a summary or description of the work, but a pointed critique that uses the work you are analyzing to offer new insight and new ideas.

### Item 5: Data report

The networked society is characterized by the problem of overabundance rather than scarcity of information. This means you must be able to to gather, analyze, and communicate large amounts of data. While not all of this information is quantitative, this portfolio item focuses on quantitative analysis. You will demonstrate your data literacy skills by:

1. Finding and downloading an interesting (and sufficiently large) data set.
2. Analyzing it using spreadsheet software.
3. Discovering something interesting in the data.
4. Creating a multimedia (textual and visual) representation of your interesting finding (like a series of graphs or an infographic).

Participation
--------------
Your participation in the class is crucial for the class to succeed for all of us. You are expected to post your work on time. You should treat your peers professionally and with respect. Your participation grade will be based on your efforts in Wordpress reading responses and comments, and in participation in Slack.
