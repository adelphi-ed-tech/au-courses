**Educational Technology 0858-502, Spring 2015**

**Keywords:** open education, deschooling, OER, free culture, 
networked learning, peer-to-peer learning, p2p learning, open source 
education, hacking education, peer production, MOOC

**Description:** Open education combines practices from Free 
Software development with (radically) student-centered pedagogy. In 
open education, free learning resources are developed 
collaboratively using the global internet, tailored locally to the 
specific needs of learners, and studied collaboratively. Students in 
this course consider the underlying principles of open education: 
why it works, when it fails, how it relates to "traditional" 
education, and what we want it to look like.

> We need to place our action in the specific context of
> domination and liberation where we live: the network society,
> built around the communication networks of the Internet.<br />
> — Manuel Castells, _Internet Galaxy_

> Now instead the common is the
> locus of freedom and innovation—free access, free use, free expression,
> free interaction—that stands against private control, that is, the
> control exerted by private property, its legal structures, and
> its market forces. Freedom in this context can only be freedom of the common.<br />
> — Michael Hardt & Antonio Negri, _Commonwealth_

> Inevitably, this hidden curriculum of schooling adds prejudice and
> guilt to the discrimination which a society practices against some
> of its members and compounds the privilege of others with a new
> title to condescend to the majority. Just as inevitably, this hidden
> curriculum serves as a ritual of initiation into a growth-oriented
> consumer society for rich and poor alike.<br />
> — Ivan Illich, _Deschooling Society_

* **In person** classes meet on Thursdays at 7pm, Manhattan Center Room 272
* **online** weeks have no set meeting time. They will be carried
  out by posting writing, video, or other media to the course website.
  You should consult with your _study group_ every week. During
  asynchronous weeks, you **must check the course website at least
  once a day.** Online weeks run from Thursday to the next Thursday.
  A typical online week looks like this:
    - Tues-Fri: do the readings
    - Sat or Sun: post your response online (300-500 words), due by end of day on Sunday
    - Mon-Tues: post at least two comments; respond to comments on your post.

Participation
----------------------------------------------

This is a reading-oriented course. Whether
class is conducted in-person or asynchronously online,
you are expected to be prepared each week. In a typical week, there
will be 40-80 pages of reading. Sometimes there will be videos to
watch as well. Let's call all of these _texts_.

When you read a text for this course, you should have two things in
mind: (1) what is the text arguing? (2) to what extent do you agree
with these arguments? You should be in touch with your study group
to discuss texts before full group discussions.

Your grade in this area will be determined by the end of term particpant survey and the instructor grade.

Session leader
----------------------------------------------

Everyone in the class will be responsible for
leading a class session, either alone or working with a partner
(depending on class size). When you sign up to lead a session, you
will either be leading an in-person seminar or an online discussion.
In either case, you should take extra time to understand the
readings for the session you are leading, take notes on the
readings, and formulate questions.

In-class seminar leaders may want to open class with a few comments
about the texts. How you choose to lead your session is up to you.

Here are some techniques that I use (you can mix, match, or ignore):

* begin with (~15 minutes) of initial free writing/journaling
  related to the texts, some participants read their entries
* formulate open questions that address a large issue in the text,
  frame the questions with specific quotations from the works we're
  studying
* distribute questions to small groups or pairs, and have them work
  independently on discussion the works. visit the groups while they
  are discussing the text and join their discussion. share with full
  group after certain time.
* ask each participant to read a line or two that they think is
  interesting or worth discussing; follow the discussion from there
* ask participants to write down one or two questions or insights
  that they have about the works. build a discussion around these.

Here are some things to avoid:

* boring your audience with a poorly organized lecture (especially easy to do with a PPT in the "book report" style)
* asking yes or no questions: "Does Ivan Illich like schools?"
* allowing the discussion to drift too far from the texts/subject being discussed
* misjudging the time it will take to discuss something
* allowing a few voices to dominate the conversation

While most of the above comments hold for **online discussions**,
there are some practical refinements for online weeks.

1. You should post a video, audio, slideshow/PPT, or written
   introduction to the texts on the first day of the session you are
   leading (we are on a Thurs-to-Thurs schedule, so your intro should be
   ready by the first Wed. evening).
2. Give explicit instructions for how, what, where your classmates
   will post their responses
3. You are the glue that will make the online discussion work. You
   must read _everything_ posted, and the faster the better. Ask
   follow-up questions and provide comments/feedback as soon as you
   can. Facilitate interaction between commenters who have similar,
   conflicting, or overlapping ideas.

Your grade in this area will be determined by the session leader survey completed
by all participants.

Open Education Report
----------------------------------------------

By the second week of the semester, you will choose an Open  Education Project
(see list below) to follow and study. You should plan to spend at least one
hour a week participating in the project. Typically, at first, this will mean
reading about it and following along. As you learn about the community, you
can contribute more to its projects.

Your final report, due in week 4, will be uploaded to the [Ed Tech Blog](http://www.auedtech.org).
As we build a number of Open Education case studies, all of the reports must have the
same format:

1. **Introduction**
    - narrative description of the project
    - sample works (screenshots, links, diagrams, etc)
    - project goals
2. **Collaboration**
    - how do participants collaborate?
    - what technologies support collaboration?
    - how is quality controlled?
    - how are decisions made and goals set?
    - who is allowed to participate and what access rights do they have?
3. **Community**
    - what principles do participants have in common?
    - how is community maintained?
    - how are new members invited or excluded?
    - how do people learn how to participate?
4. **Openness**
    - in what ways is this project "open"?
    - consider: licenses, technologies, production model, output model, access, cost, APIs
    - how does it fit in with other projects?
5. **Conclusion**
    - how important is this project?
    - what is its potential impact?
    - does it reflect best educational practices and learning sciences?
    - does it support or enhance the social/political goals of education?

Your report should be concise, well edited, and prepared in a way
that will make it useful for a general audience interested in
technology and open education. Aim 2 pages (500-700 words).

Critical Essay
----------------------------------------------

Choose an area of interest that has arisen out of
the course readings and discussions and write a reflective essay on
this topic. Follow 
[Chris Higgins' Notes on the critical-interpretive essay](http://www.studyplace.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_critical-interpretive_essay)
for the structure of this essay, which should be: _focused_,
_interesting_, _motivated_, and _controversial_. The chapters in
_Cognitive Capitalism, Education, and Digital Labor_ are typical of
writing in this style. You should refer closely to the texts that we
engage with during the semester in your writing. Your work must
properly cite your sources, using APA styled references. You may include endnotes in your
essay as well.

Essays must be approximately 2,500 words long. They
will be posted on the [Educational Technology Blog](http://www.auedtech.org). 
This is strictly an individual assignment (one essay per
person). You should work with your study group to draft and improve
your essay. I strongly suggest that everyone schedule an appointment
with the [Writing Center](http://students.adelphi.edu/writingcenter/)
before you turn in your draft, and then again before you turn in
your final essay.

_Your final essay is due on 5/14._ Late work will not be accepted
for this assignment and **there will not be an opportunity to re-write
your final essay.**

Your grade for the final paper will be based on the jouranl article
evaluation process from the _[Journal of Peer Production](http://peerproduction.net/)_

Their reviewers consider:

1. Is the subject matter relevant? (6 points)
2. Is the treatment of the subject matter intellectually interesting? _Does the author cite relevant literature to support the claims_? (6 points)
3. Are there any noticeable problems with the author’s means of validating assumptions or making judgments? (6 points)
4. Is the article well written? (7 points)
    - **1 point** indicates that the writing renders the essay extremely difficult to follow, regardless of the merits of the argument. Essays will receive 1 point for writing if any of these conditions are met, or a are met in combination:
        - 5 or more incomplete or run on sentences
        - 8 or more spelling errors
        - 5 or more grammatical errors
        - no citations in the text or missing references section
    - **2 points** indicates an essay with significant problems in grammar, spelling, and norms of academic writing
    - **3 points** indicates an essay that follows the basic conventions of academic writing and has been edited to remove most spelling errors (<3) and common grammatical errors. Essays at this level exhibit awkwardly phrased sentences, poor word choice, organization, and lack strong transitions.
    - **4 points**. Everyone should strive for at least 4 points for the writing of their essay. 4-point essays are basic, but well written works. They will be edited to remove lower order concerns such as spelling and grammar and also have the basic structure of higher order concerns: structured to develop argument, offers supporting details, parsimonious and focused. Essays at this level may have inconsistent or improper citations, suffer from awkward phrasing ad poor word choice, and lack transitions.
    - **5 points** will be awarded for essays that are well edited, consistently use academic citations, and read fluidly and consistently. These essays will be improved by focusing on higher order concerns, making sentences more precise, stating ideas more clearly, and using grammar and word choice to enhance further enhance the themes of the essay.
    - **6 point** essays read fluidly and exhibit a strong authorial voice and mastery of rhetorical structures, using wit, narrative, passion, etc. Each idea is fully developed while retaining our principle of parsimony.
    - **7 points**, like 6 point essays, but also edited to the point where they are error free and suitable for print. It is very difficult to prepare an essay at this level without feedback from other readers.

For this essay, you may use Chicago, MLA, or APA styled citation, but must be consistent in how you apply them (don't switch styles). In addition to the references, you may include endnotes if necessary. The [Purdue Owling Writing Lab](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/2/) is a good resource for citations as well as the basic elements of academic writing.

Adapted from [Process: Appendix A](http://peerproduction.net/peer-review/process/). _modifications appear in italics_

Your paper will be graded by the professor and by an external reviewer from a pool of Adelphi faculty, faculty at other institutions, graduates for the Ed Tech program, and other experts in the field. The external review will be a blind review—the reviewer will not know the author's identity and the author will not know the reviewer's identity.

If your work is plagiarized or otherwise violates [Adelphi's Code of Academic] you will receive zero points for this assignment with no opportunity to re-write it.



Open Education Projects
====================================

This is a selected list of open education projects. You will take a
several weeks to try to get to know one of these projects, and
then report back what you learned to the group. Here are some
questions that might inform you study:


* should this project be considered open? why?
* what does the project _produce_?
* does this project make use of good eduational practice, as you understand it?
* who contributes to the project? is it hard to participate?
* who is the audience for this project?
* who does or is likely to benefit the most if this project succeeds?
