**Educational Technology 0858-502, Spring 2015**

**Keywords:** open education, deschooling, OER, free culture, 
networked learning, peer-to-peer learning, p2p learning, open source 
education, hacking education, peer production, MOOC

**Description:** Open education combines practices from Free 
Software development with (radically) student-centered pedagogy. In 
open education, free learning resources are developed 
collaboratively using the global internet, tailored locally to the 
specific needs of learners, and studied collaboratively. Students in 
this course consider the underlying principles of open education: 
why it works, when it fails, how it relates to "traditional" 
education, and what we want it to look like.

> We need to place our action in the specific context of
> domination and liberation where we live: the network society,
> built around the communication networks of the Internet.<br />
> — Manuel Castells, _Internet Galaxy_

> Now instead the common is the
> locus of freedom and innovation—free access, free use, free expression,
> free interaction—that stands against private control, that is, the
> control exerted by private property, its legal structures, and
> its market forces. Freedom in this context can only be freedom of the common.<br />
> — Michael Hardt & Antonio Negri, _Commonwealth_

> Inevitably, this hidden curriculum of schooling adds prejudice and
> guilt to the discrimination which a society practices against some
> of its members and compounds the privilege of others with a new
> title to condescend to the majority. Just as inevitably, this hidden
> curriculum serves as a ritual of initiation into a growth-oriented
> consumer society for rich and poor alike.<br />
> — Ivan Illich, _Deschooling Society_

Participation
----------------------------------------------

This will be a reading-heavy course. Whether
class is conducted in-person or asynchronously online,
you are expected to be prepared each week. In a typical week, there
will be 40-80 pages of reading. Sometimes there will be videos to
watch as well. Let's call all of these _texts_.

When you read a text for this course, you should have two things in
mind: (1) what is the text arguing? (2) to what extent do you agree
with these arguments? You should be in touch with your study group
to discuss texts before full group discussions.

Your grade in this area will be a combination of self-, instructor-,
and peer-evaluations.

Session leader
----------------------------------------------

Everyone in the class will be responsible for
leading a class session, either alone or working with a partner
(depending on class size). When you sign up to lead a session, you
will either be leading an in-person seminar or an online discussion.
In either case, you should take extra time to understand the
readings for the session you are leading, take notes on the
readings, and formulate questions.

In-class seminar leaders may want to open class with a few comments
about the texts. How you choose to lead your session is up to you.\
Here are some techniques that I use (you can mix, match, or ignore):

* begin with (~15 minutes) of initial free writing/journaling
  related to the texts, some participants read their entries
* formulate open questions that address a large issue in the text,
  frame the questions with specific quotations from the works we're
  studying
* distribute questions to small groups or pairs, and have them work
  independently on discussion the works. visit the groups while they
  are discussing the text and join their discussion. share with full
  group after certain time.
* ask each participant to read a line or two that they think is
  interesting or worth discussing; follow the discussion from there
* ask participants to write down one or two questions or insights
  that they have about the works. build a discussion around these.

Here are some things to avoid:

* boring your audience with a poorly organized lecture (especially easy to do with a PPT in the "book report" style)
* asking yes or no questions: "Does Ivan Illich like schools?"
* allowing the discussion to drift too far from the texts/subject being discussed
* misjudging the time it will take to discuss something
* allowing a few voices to dominate the conversation

While most of the above comments hold for **online discussions**,
there are some practical refinements for online weeks.

1. You should post a video, audio, slideshow/PPT, or written
   introduction to the texts on the first day of the session you are
   leading (we are on a Tues-to-Tues schedule, so your intro should be
   ready by the first Wed. evening).
2. Give explicit instructions for how, what, where your classmates
   will post their responses
3. You are the glue that will make the online discussion work. You
   must read _everything_ posted, and the faster the better. Ask
   follow-up questions and provide comments/feedback as soon as you
   can. Facilitate interaction between commenters who have similar,
   conflicting, or overlapping ideas.

Your grade in this area will be a combination of self-, instructor-, and peer-evaluations.

Open Education Report
----------------------------------------------

By the second week of the semester, you will choose an Open  Education Project
(see list below) to follow and study. You should plan to spend at least one
hour a week participating in the project. Typically, at first, this will mean
reading about it and following along. As you learn about the community, you
can contribute more to its projects.

Your final report, due in week 7, will be uploaded to the [Ed Tech Blog](http://au-ed-tech.blogspot.com).
As we build a number of Open Education case studies, all of the reports must have the
same format:

Introduction
  ~ narrative description of the project
  ~ sample works (screenshots, links, diagrams, etc)
  ~ project goals
Collaboration
  ~ how do participants collaborate?
  ~ what technologies support collaboration?
  ~ how is quality controlled?
  ~ how are decisions made and goals set?
  ~ who is allowed to participate and what access rights do they have?
Community
  ~ what principles do participants have in common?
  ~ how is community maintained?
  ~ how are new members invited or excluded?
  ~ how do people learn how to participate?
Openness
  ~ in what ways is this project "open"?
  ~ consider: licenses, technologies, production model, output model, access, cost, APIs
  ~ how does it fit in with other projects?
Conclusion
  ~ how important is this project?
  ~ what is its potential impact?
  ~ does it reflect best educational practices and learning sciences?
  ~ does it support or enhance the social/political goals of education?

Your report should be concise, well edited, and prepared in a way
that will make it useful for a general audience interested in
technology and open education. Aim for about 3 pages.

Critical Essay
----------------------------------------------

Choose an area of interest that has arisen out of
the course readings and discussions and write a reflective essay on
this topic. Follow [Chris Higgins' Notes on the
critical-interpretive
essay](http://www.studyplace.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_critical-interpretive_essay)
for the structure of this essay, which should be: _focused_,
_interesting_, _motivated_, and _controversial_. The chapters in
_Cognitive Capitalism, Education, and Digital Labor_ are typical of
writing in this style. You should refer closely to the texts that we
engage with during the semester in your writing. Your work must
properly cite your sources, using APA styled references. You may include endnotes in your
essay as well.

Essays must be approximately 2,500 words long. They
will be posted on the [Educational Technology Blog](http://au-ed-tech.blogspot.com). 
This is strictly an individual assignment (one essay per
person). You should work with your study group to draft and improve
your essay. I strongly suggest that everyone schedule an appointment
with the [Writing Center](http://students.adelphi.edu/writingcenter/)
before you turn in your draft, and then again before you turn in
your final essay.

**Your final essay is due on 5/13.** Late work will not be accepted
for this assignment and there will not be an opportunity to re-write
your final draft.

Your grade for the final paper will be based on the jouranl article
evaluation process from the _[Journal of Peer Production](http://peerproduction.net/)_

Their reviewers consider:

1. Is the subject matter relevant?
2. Is the treatment of the subject matter intellectually interesting? _Does the author cite relevant literature to support the claims_?
3. Are there any noticeable problems with the author’s means of validating assumptions or making judgments?
4. Is the article well written?

Lightning talk
------------------------

A [lightning talk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) is a 
short presentation, typically on a small, but engaging topic. We 
will follow the "ignite" format, where every presenter uploads 20 
slides (powerpoint or libreoffice/open document presentation) timed
to automatically advance at 15 seconds (for a 5 minute presentation).

The topic is up to you—anything related to our themes in Open Education.


Open Education Projects
====================================

This is a selected list of open education projects. You will take a
several weeks to try to get to know one of these projects, and
then report back what you learned to the group. Here are some
questions that might inform you study:

* should this project be considered open? why?
* what does the project _produce_?
* does this project make use of good eduational practice, as you understand it?
* who contributes to the project? is it hard to participate?
* who is the audience for this project?
* who does or is likely to benefit the most if this project succeeds?
