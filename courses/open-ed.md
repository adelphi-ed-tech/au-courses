**Educational Technology 0858-502, Fall 2015**

**Keywords:** open education, deschooling, OER, free culture, 
networked learning, peer-to-peer learning, p2p learning, open source 
education, hacking education, peer production, MOOC

**Description:** Open education combines practices from Free 
Software development with (radically) student-centered pedagogy. In 
open education, free learning resources are developed 
collaboratively using the global internet, tailored locally to the 
specific needs of learners, and studied collaboratively. Students in 
this course consider the underlying principles of open education: 
why it works, when it fails, how it relates to "traditional" 
education, and what we want it to look like.

> We need to place our action in the specific context of
> domination and liberation where we live: the network society,
> built around the communication networks of the Internet.<br />
> — Manuel Castells, _Internet Galaxy_

> Now instead the common is the
> locus of freedom and innovation—free access, free use, free expression,
> free interaction—that stands against private control, that is, the
> control exerted by private property, its legal structures, and
> its market forces. Freedom in this context can only be freedom of the common.<br />
> — Michael Hardt & Antonio Negri, _Commonwealth_

> Inevitably, this hidden curriculum of schooling adds prejudice and
> guilt to the discrimination which a society practices against some
> of its members and compounds the privilege of others with a new
> title to condescend to the majority. Just as inevitably, this hidden
> curriculum serves as a ritual of initiation into a growth-oriented
> consumer society for rich and poor alike.<br />
> — Ivan Illich, _Deschooling Society_

Assignments
====================================

#### Due Dates and Grading

Assignment                   Due             % of final grade
---------------------------  --------------  -----------------
Participation                ongoing         30%
Open Education Report        Oct 20          30%
Critical Essay               Dec 15          40%

Participation
----------------------------------------------

This is a reading-oriented course. Whether
class is conducted in-person or asynchronously online,
you are expected to be prepared each week. In a typical week, there
will be 40-80 pages of reading. Sometimes there will be videos to
watch as well. Let's call all of these _texts_.

When you read a text for this course, you should have two things in
mind: (1) what is the text arguing? (2) to what extent do you agree
with these arguments? You should be in touch with your study group
to discuss texts before full group discussions.

Your grade in this area will be determined by the end of term particpant survey and the instructor grade.

Open Education Report
----------------------------------------------

By the second week of the semester, you will choose an Open Education Project
(see list below) to follow and study. You should plan to spend at least one
hour a week participating in the project. Typically, at first, this will mean
reading about it and following along. As you learn about the community, you
can contribute more to its projects.

At our meeting on October 20, everyone will report back on the community they have been working with. You should consider:

1. **Basics**
    - narrative description of the project
    - sample works (screenshots, links, diagrams, etc)
    - project goals
2. **Collaboration**
    - how do participants collaborate?
    - what technologies support collaboration?
    - how is quality controlled?
    - how are decisions made and goals set?
    - who is allowed to participate and what access rights do they have?
3. **Community**
    - what principles do participants have in common?
    - how is community maintained?
    - how are new members invited or excluded?
    - how do people learn how to participate?
4. **Openness**
    - in what ways is this project "open"?
    - consider: licenses, technologies, production model, output model, access, cost, APIs
    - how does it fit in with other projects?
5. **Insight**
    - how important is this project?
    - what is its potential impact?
    - does it reflect best educational practices and learning sciences?
    - does it support or enhance the social/political goals of education?

You will prepare a 5 minute lightning talk [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk#Definition_and_format)] [[2](https://barriebyron.wordpress.com/2013/02/17/so-you-want-to-give-a-lightning-talk/)] about your project to present to the group. From there, we will have a general discussion of the projects.

Critical Essay
----------------------------------------------

Choose an area of interest that has arisen out of
the course readings and discussions and write a reflective essay on
this topic. Follow 
[Chris Higgins' Notes on the critical-interpretive essay](http://www.studyplace.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_critical-interpretive_essay)
for the structure of this essay, which should be: _focused_,
_interesting_, _motivated_, and _controversial_. The chapters in
_Cognitive Capitalism, Education, and Digital Labor_ are typical of
writing in this style. You should refer closely to the texts that we
engage with during the semester in your writing. Your work must
properly cite your sources, using APA styled references. You may include endnotes in your
essay as well.

Essays must be approximately 2,500 words long.
This is strictly an individual assignment (one essay per
person). I strongly suggest that everyone schedule an appointment
with the [Writing Center](http://students.adelphi.edu/writingcenter/)
before you turn in your draft, and then again before you turn in
your final essay.

Late work will not be accepted
for this assignment and **there will not be an opportunity to re-write
your final essay.**

Your grade for the final paper will be based on the jouranl article
evaluation process from the _[Journal of Peer Production](http://peerproduction.net/)_

Their reviewers consider:

1. Is the subject matter relevant? (6 points)
2. Is the treatment of the subject matter intellectually interesting? _Does the author cite relevant literature to support the claims_? (6 points)
3. Are there any noticeable problems with the author’s means of validating assumptions or making judgments? (6 points)
4. Is the article well written? (7 points)
    - **1 point** indicates that the writing renders the essay extremely difficult to follow, regardless of the merits of the argument. Essays will receive 1 point for writing if any of these conditions are met, or a are met in combination:
        - 5 or more incomplete or run on sentences
        - 8 or more spelling errors
        - 5 or more grammatical errors
        - no citations in the text or missing references section
    - **2 points** indicates an essay with significant problems in grammar, spelling, and norms of academic writing
    - **3 points** indicates an essay that follows the basic conventions of academic writing and has been edited to remove most spelling errors (<3) and common grammatical errors. Essays at this level exhibit awkwardly phrased sentences, poor word choice, organization, and lack strong transitions.
    - **4 points**. Everyone should strive for at least 4 points for the writing of their essay. 4-point essays are basic, but well written works. They will be edited to remove lower order concerns such as spelling and grammar and also have the basic structure of higher order concerns: structured to develop argument, offers supporting details, parsimonious and focused. Essays at this level may have inconsistent or improper citations, suffer from awkward phrasing ad poor word choice, and lack transitions.
    - **5 points** will be awarded for essays that are well edited, consistently use academic citations, and read fluidly and consistently. These essays will be improved by focusing on higher order concerns, making sentences more precise, stating ideas more clearly, and using grammar and word choice to enhance further enhance the themes of the essay.
    - **6 point** essays read fluidly and exhibit a strong authorial voice and mastery of rhetorical structures, using wit, narrative, passion, etc. Each idea is fully developed while retaining our principle of parsimony.
    - **7 points**, like 6 point essays, but also edited to the point where they are error free and suitable for print. It is very difficult to prepare an essay at this level without feedback from other readers.

Adapted from [Process: Appendix A](http://peerproduction.net/peer-review/process/). _modifications appear in italics_

For this essay, you may use Chicago, MLA, or APA styled citation, but must be consistent in how you apply them (don't switch styles). In addition to the references, you may include endnotes if necessary. The [Purdue Owling Writing Lab](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/2/) is a good resource for citations as well as the basic elements of academic writing.

If your work is plagiarized or otherwise violates [Adelphi's Code of Academic] you will receive zero points for this assignment with no opportunity to re-write it.


Open Education Projects
====================================

This is a selected list of open education projects. You will take a
several weeks to try to get to know one of these projects, and
then report back what you learned to the group. Here are some
questions that might inform you study:


* should this project be considered open? why?
* what does the project _produce_?
* does this project make use of good eduational practice, as you understand it?
* who contributes to the project? is it hard to participate?
* who is the audience for this project?
* who does or is likely to benefit the most if this project succeeds?
