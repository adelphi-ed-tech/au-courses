**School based practicum of educational technology 0858-801, Fall 2013**

**Keywords:**  educational technology specialist, ed tech practicum,
technology coordinator, student teaching, ISTE NETS

**Description:** EDT 801 is a field-based course where students put their developing
talents as educational technologists into practice in K-12 schools in
the Long Island and New York City region. Students pursuing the New York
State Educational Technology Specialist certification _must_ experience
placements in elementary (1-6) and segundary (7-12) school settings.
Additionally, at least one placement site will be in a school with a
diverse student population and one placement will be in a technology-rich
school.

Each student will work with a field-based mentor who is a regular
employee of a K-12 public school in New York State. Typically field
mentors are school or district technology coordinators, school
computer or media teachers, principals or assistant principals who have
primary responsiblities for technology planning and implementation, or
classroom teachers who fill technology leadership roles in their
schools. In addition to the field mentor, the course is led by
a university faculty supervisor.

_None._

Field-based practicum
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Students will work in 2 different school systems during the course of 
the semester. Their placements will be sequential; you will not be
working in two sites at the same time. Students are expected to spend 10
hours each week working on projects for their sites, including at least
6 hours each week on-site. Typically, these 6 hours are completed once
a week during school hours, or twice a week during after-school hours.
Students are expected to be on-site for additional horus, as needed, to
complete their projects and per requirements by their field supervisor.

University seminar
------------------------------------------------------------------------

During university seminars students discuss their placements, get help
on projects from faculty supervisors and cohort, and demonstrate their
progress to their peers. In Fall 2013, the cohort will meet in person
every-other-week. During intervening weeks, support and discussion
will be carried out through Moodle and other online tools.

Practicum projects & assessment
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Students will complete 3 major projects in their partner schools during
the course of the practicum. The projects will be assessed by their 
field-based mentor and faculty supervisor through field observations
and portfolio assessments. The projects reflect the expectations for 
practicing Educational Technology Specialists working in New York 
State public schools and meet the standards outlined by ISTE, the
[International Society for Technology in Education](http://iste.org).

Projects do not need to be completed in the order detailed below. The
scope of the projects and sequence of their implementation will be
developed by the interns in consultation with their school-based mentor
and faculty supervisor. Projects will be completed individually or in
collaboration with other interns, as appropriate.

### Project 1: Technology infrastructure

For this projects students will work develop a project to help improve
the technical infrastructure of the school. Infrastructure improvements
may take several different forms. For example:

* facilities improvements: installing new software or operating systems
  on school computers; installing more wireless access points to improve
  wifi network
* processes: create new procedures for tech support; implement new
  system for hardware, software, or media management
* development: find and apply for grants to improve the school's use
  of technology; create budget and implementation plans for future
  improvements; improve the school or district's technology plan

[**Assessment of this project will follow the standards detailed in the
ISTE NETS for Administrators (NETS•A)**](http://www.iste.org/standards/nets-for-administrators)

### Project 2: Professional development

Working closely with school mentors, interns will conduct a needs
assessment of their host school to determine what areas of professional
development are most needed and will have the most direct impact on
student achievement. They will develop and implement a professional
development series informed by current evidence-based practices of
"embedded" professional development; models that occur over time and
focus on coaching. It's possible that the _professional development_
and _co-teaching_ projects will be coordinated.

[**Assessment of this project will follow the standards detailed in the
ISTE NETS for Coaches (NETS•C)**](http://www.iste.org/standards/nets-for-coaches)

### Project 3: Co-teaching

For this project interns will be paired with classroom teachers who
share their same domain background for teaching. Working with this
master teacher, the intern will infuse review an existing unit that
makes up part of the school's curriculum and then find ways to infuse
the unit with suitable technologies. The intern will create appropriate,
formal or informal, assessment measures to validate that the technology
interventions contribute to student achievement. The intern will
push-in with the master teacher to teach the technology-enhanced lessons.
In most cases this project will take place during regular school hours,
but if the situation allows, it can occur in afterschool programs that
have academic focuses.

ISTE NETS for Teachers (NETS•T)**](http://www.iste.org/standards/nets-for-teachers)
