<h2 id="spring-2020-studio-smart-cities">Spring 2020 Studio: Smart Cities</h2>

<p><img style="max-width:300px;" src="https://resize.pubpub.org/fit-in/600x0/gg1qmkps/01552071556663.jpg" alt="cover from The Smart Enough City" /></p>

<p>Each semester the multimedia studio features a different challenge, dealing with an
important, global topic. Students will be asked to work on a semester
long multimedia project that teaches some aspect of this challenge.</p>

<p>The Spring 2020 Studio theme is <strong>smart cities</strong>. A smart city wants to use
embedded digital technologies and data flows improve the lives of the people in
the city. Critics caution that smart cities might offer little advantage to the
people, while entrenching unequal power structures and exacerbating existing
problems stemming from inequality and poverty. The projects in this studio
should help us – and anyone – to better understand the potential benefits and
pitfalls of smart cities. Each participant in the studio will become expert in a
particular aspect of smart cities (e.g. transportation, crime, education,
health, tech) and design their multimedia project around that topic. Taken
together, our studio projects should present our vision of what a smart city
should look like.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>This course is designed to challenge students to develop their abilities
as instructional designers and as authors and producers of digital media
for learning. Specifically, they should learn to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>design an effective digital learning environment that is intuitive
to use and follows principles of Universal Design for Learning</li>
  <li>develop in-depth skill in one area of digital production: video
editing, graphic design, game design, computer programming, web
design, etc.</li>
  <li>understand key concepts of instructional design, including meeting
the needs of the target audience, assessing learning outcomes,
and following sound and ethical pedagogical principles</li>
  <li>think creatively about far-reaching challenges in teaching and
learning</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the studio, every student will have a high quality, published
multimedia artifact that will be part of their portfolio.</p>

<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>

<p>Everyone is expected to participate fully in class. This means meeting deadlines
for online posts and, coming to class sessions prepared by having read the
readings. During “studio” work sessions, you will be expected to post an update
of your progress with screenshots.</p>

<h3 id="briefings">Briefings</h3>

<p>The “briefing” session will help us develop our domain knowledge of smart
cities. You will choose a specific topic of your choice related to smart cities
and then create a 3-minute briefing report – a narrated slide show on your
topic. Your report should represent your best understanding of multimedia
learning. The last slide should be the bibliography used to create your
briefing. You should have at least 3 sources, one of them being an academic
source. The specific topic of your briefing will probably relate to the aspect
of smart cities that you will highlight in your multimedia project.</p>

<h3 id="multimedia-on-multimedia">Multimedia on multimedia</h3>

<p>Working with a partner, you will create a multimedia slideshow that demonstrates
the key multimedia cognition concepts covered in <em>E-Learning and the Science of
Instruction</em>. The book is available online from the Adelphi Library. The total
presentation must be between 10-15 minutes long. You are only required to read
the chapter for the week you are presenting, but everyone is encouraged to read
the chapters. You should supplement your presentation with outside readings and
examples as necessary. You should actively work to implement the multimedia
principles you are discussing in the design of your presentation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>multimedia 1:</strong> chapters 4 &amp; 5</li>
  <li><strong>multimedia 2:</strong> chapters 6 &amp; 7</li>
  <li><strong>multimedia 3:</strong> chapters 8, 9, &amp; 10</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="workshops-multimedia-tutorial">Workshops: multimedia tutorial</h3>

<p>Choose a multimedia authoring tool that you know well or want to become expert
in. Design a 10-15 minute tutorial that describes how (and why/when) to use it.
If it is a large or complex tool (GIMP, Tableau), then choose a specific
feature or technique to cover.</p>

<p>Your workshop should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Begin with a general discussion of the types of multimedia produced:
    <ul>
      <li>show specific examples</li>
      <li>discuss how they match our understanding of multimedia principles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Demonstrate the key techniques of the tool. In order to show the tool, you
might need to prepare some work in several different stages, in the interest
of time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please post your tutorial as a single multimedia video (on YouTube) and post
the link in our “multimedia tutorial” discussion forum (with its own title).
Monitor the forum for feedback and questions regarding your tool.</p>

<h2 id="multimedia-project">Multimedia project</h2>
<p>The culminating work for this class is your <em>multimedia project</em>. Everyone will
work on their own individual project. They will produce a multimedia work that
demonstrates their skills as a designer and producer of multimedia, their
knowledge of the studio topic, and their understanding of the learning sciences
of multimedia.</p>

<p>You should begin thinking about your project during the first week of class. Consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what types of multimedia do you find the most interesting and engaging?</li>
  <li>what are your strengths?</li>
  <li>what would you like to learn more about?</li>
  <li>what skills and demos would you like to highlight as a professional educational technologist?</li>
</ul>

<p>Past Studio projects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>instructional videos</li>
  <li>documentary videos</li>
  <li>animations</li>
  <li>data visualizations</li>
  <li>infographics</li>
  <li>(analog) learning games</li>
  <li>video games</li>
  <li>captivate courses</li>
  <li>self-paced online courses</li>
  <li>simulations</li>
  <li>interactive websites</li>
  <li>mobile/location based learning systems</li>
  <li>interactive stories</li>
  <li>multimedia textbooks</li>
  <li>map/spatial multimedia</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pitch">Pitch</h3>

<p>You will formally pitch your idea for your your final project. The purpose of
the pitch is to propose your project in a way that makes it sound exciting,
worthwhile, and feasible. You want to tell a good story about what you plan to
develop. You should also have some sketches, mockups, sample art, etc. that may
be required to make your point.</p>

<p>Plan for a 5 minute presentation.</p>

<h3 id="critique">Critique</h3>
<p>You will formally present your work in progress to get feedback from the instructor
and your peers. You should have a solid plan for completing the project.</p>

<p><strong>Critique and Final Evaluation Criteria</strong>
<em>Refer to these criteria for the evaluation of your multimedia project.</em></p>

<h4 id="originality--innovation">Originality &amp; innovation</h4>
<p>Does the project take a novel approach to teaching with digital media? Does
it combine existing practices in new ways, for a new effect? Does it
address an important topic, or hard to teach concept that is relevant
to the topic of the studio? In other words, how <em>important</em> is the learning
goal for the project?</p>

<p>Students will lose points in originality for verbatim translating of
existing learning solutions to the new problem space.</p>

<h4 id="design">Design</h4>
<p>The design of the project encompasses the information, interaction, and
visual design. Points to consider when evaluating the design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is the navigation consistent, logical, and easily understood?</li>
  <li>does the graphic design engage users?</li>
  <li>does the look and feel support the learning goals of the project?</li>
  <li>does the user interface take advantage of existing conventions, UI
widgets, and user patterns?</li>
  <li>are there clear paths through the system to accomplish user goals?</li>
  <li>are system messages and instructions consistent and clear?</li>
  <li>does the overall design exhibit a level of professionalism and
polish that supports trust by the user?</li>
  <li>is the design accessible?
    <ul>
      <li>does it support the widest possible range of computer systems
(including OS, web browser, screen size/mobile, processor speed,
internet connection quality)</li>
      <li>can it be accessed by users with disabilities, where
appropriate?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="technique">Technique</h4>
<p>The project’s technique reflects the proficiency of the producer with the
tools of the digital studio. All aspects of the project should be well
tested for smooth operation. Users should not easily “break” the system.
The specifics of development depend on the media. So, each of the
various skills required for the course will be evaluated based on the
practice of expert practitioners.</p>

<ul>
  <li>is video composed and edited like an expert video?</li>
  <li>does software meet the speed and reliability that an expert would
expect?</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="learning-science">Learning science</h4>
<p>At the end, this studio challenge is about learning. Points in this
category are awarded for exhibiting a thorough understanding of how
people learn with digital artifacts. Successful projects will account
for the cognitive, social, pragmatic, ethical, and aesthetic
implications of their design, as it impacts learning.</p>
