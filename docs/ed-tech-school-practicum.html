                    <p><strong>School based practicum of educational technology 0858-801, Fall 2013</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> educational technology specialist, ed tech practicum, technology coordinator, student teaching, ISTE NETS</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> EDT 801 is a field-based course where students put their developing talents as educational technologists into practice in K-12 schools in the Long Island and New York City region. Students pursuing the New York State Educational Technology Specialist certification <em>must</em> experience placements in elementary (1-6) and segundary (7-12) school settings. Additionally, at least one placement site will be in a school with a diverse student population and one placement will be in a technology-rich school.</p>
                    <p>Each student will work with a field-based mentor who is a regular employee of a K-12 public school in New York State. Typically field mentors are school or district technology coordinators, school computer or media teachers, principals or assistant principals who have primary responsiblities for technology planning and implementation, or classroom teachers who fill technology leadership roles in their schools. In addition to the field mentor, the course is led by a university faculty supervisor.</p>

                    <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
                    <p>Students who complete this course should be ready to assume technology leadership roles in K-12 schools. In particular, they should be prepared to:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>plan and teach a series of enrichment classes for students, in an area of computers and digital media (digital video, game design, robotics, programming, web design) or in a content area with technology enrichment</li>
                    <li>write a technology grant for the school</li>
                    <li>create or improve the school websites, especially to make it a learning resource for students and families</li>
                    <li>design and implement professional development for the school’s teachers and staff based on mentoring and coachning models that are proven effective on fostering more effective pedagogy</li>
                    <li>install or upgrade the learning technology infrastructure in the school computer lab, classrooms, or library</li>
                    <li>develop a multi-year technology plan</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Field-based practicum</h2>
                    <p>Students will work in 2 different school systems during the course of the semester. Their placements will be sequential; you will not be working in two sites at the same time. Students are expected to spend 10 hours each week working on projects for their sites, including at least 6 hours each week on-site. Typically, these 6 hours are completed once a week during school hours, or twice a week during after-school hours. Students are expected to be on-site for additional horus, as needed, to complete their projects and per requirements by their field supervisor. In most cases practicum students will need to clear 1 or 2 days during the practicum during school hours (typically 8am-3pm) where they can be on their school sites to work with K-12 students. Other times are more flexible and may combine on-site meetings during administrative hours and after school (3pm-6pm) as well as off-site work according to the practicum student’s schedule.</p>

                    <h2>University seminar</h2>
                    <p>During university seminars students discuss their placements, get help on projects from faculty supervisors and cohort, and demonstrate their progress to their peers. In Fall 2013, the cohort will meet in person every-other-week. During intervening weeks, support and discussion will be carried out through Moodle and other online tools.</p>

                    <h2>Practicum projects &amp; assessment</h2>
                    <p>Students will complete 3 major projects in their partner schools during the course of the practicum. The projects will be assessed by their field-based mentor and faculty supervisor through field observations and portfolio assessments. The projects reflect the expectations for practicing Educational Technology Specialists working in New York State public schools and meet the standards outlined by ISTE, the <a href="http://iste.org">International Society for Technology in Education</a>.</p>
                    <p>Projects do not need to be completed in the order detailed below. The scope of the projects and sequence of their implementation will be developed by the interns in consultation with their school-based mentor and faculty supervisor. Projects will be completed individually or in collaboration with other interns, as appropriate.</p>

                    <p>For this projects students will work develop a project to help improve the technical infrastructure of the school. Infrastructure improvements may take several different forms. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>facilities improvements: installing new software or operating systems on school computers; installing more wireless access points to improve wifi network</li>
                    <li>processes: create new procedures for tech support; implement new system for hardware, software, or media management</li>
                    <li>development: find and apply for grants to improve the school’s use of technology; create budget and implementation plans for future improvements; improve the school or district’s technology plan</li>

                    <h3>Project 2: Professional development</h3>
                    <p>Working closely with school mentors, interns will conduct a needs assessment of their host school to determine what areas of professional development are most needed and will have the most direct impact on student achievement. They will develop and implement a professional development series informed by current evidence-based practices of “embedded” professional development; models that occur over time and focus on coaching. It’s possible that the <em>professional development</em> and <em>co-teaching</em> projects will be coordinated.</p>

                    <p>For this project interns will be paired with classroom teachers who share their same domain background for teaching. Working with this master teacher, the intern will infuse review an existing unit that makes up part of the school’s curriculum and then find ways to infuse the unit with suitable technologies. The intern will create appropriate, formal or informal, assessment measures to validate that the technology interventions contribute to student achievement. The intern will push-in with the master teacher to teach the technology-enhanced lessons. In most cases this project will take place during regular school hours, but if the situation allows, it can occur in afterschool programs that have academic focuses.</p>

<h2>The Center for Academic Support and Enrichment (CASE; formerly The Learning and Writing Centers)</h2>
<p>
CASE programs and services--like individual tutoring in writing and subjects across the
curriculum, small group study sessions, academic coaching, and targeted workshops--help
students explore, deepen, and extend their classroom learning. Support programming focuses
on establishing foundational skills and techniques of studentship, like time management and
note-taking. Enrichment services develop higher-order critical thinking skills and problem solving
skills inherent in both abstractions and applications of curricular study.

<h2>The Adelphi Honor Code</h2>
<p>
  The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to
  this pursuit is academic integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s
  Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to uphold the principles of honesty and civility
  embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth and honesty and I will
  forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h3>Code of Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying,
cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation
  marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to
  produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized
  collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is
  plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-
  generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of
  plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as
  ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or
  otherwise) for student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are,
  please reach out to me to discuss it as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic
  integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review and could result in
  disciplinary action. <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty</a>.
</p>

<h2>Diversity statement</h2>
We value human dignity and diversity in all forms, embrace our differences, and honor all
voices. We understand the collective power inherent in fully inclusive communities where each
may meet their full potential to contribute.


<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that
the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and
students are strongly encouraged to respond. Please be assured that your responses are
anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after course grades have
been submitted after the semester ends.

<h2>Religious observance policy</h2>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious
observances. Students who anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are
required by Adelphi University to notify their professors at the start of the semester. This will
allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their course exam and
assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on
those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment
deadline missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out
suitable arrangements for make-ups or other satisfaction of academic requirements.
