                    study approaches to understanding data generated by
                    and from learners, and methods for using this data
                    to improve learning experiences and outcomes. We
                    learn how to gather and mine educational data as
                    well as tools and techniques for analyzing and
                    visualizing this data.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>Learning analytics is the measurement,
                    collection, analysis, and reporting of data about
                    learners and their contexts, for the purposes of
                    understanding and optimizing learning and the
                    environments in which it occurs.<br />

                    <h1>Course Communications</h1>
                    <p>This is a <em>fully online course</em>. There is
                    no set class time for video chat or live lectures.
                    However, we will be following a weekly format. You
                    are welcome to read and work ahead, but we are a
                    learning community and will be discussing the course
                    materials both formally (on Moodle) and informally
                    each week. This course begins on Tuesday, May 28 and
                    ends on Sunday, August 11. The course is organized
                    into weekly modules that will run on a
                    Tuesday-to-Monday schedule.</p>
                    <p>Participants in this course must actively
                    participate in our suite of online communications
                    tools, including Slack (<a
                    href="https://auedtech.slack.com"
                    class="uri">https://auedtech.slack.com</a>), Adelphi
                    email, and the course website.</p>
                    <p>You <em>must</em> check your Adelphi email and
                    the <code>#learninganalytics</code> channel on Slack
                    <strong>at least once a day</strong>. It is highly
                    recommended that you install the Slack mobile client
                    and an email client on your mobile phone so that you
                    receive “push notifications” of course
                    announcements.</p>
                    <p>The best place to post general course questions
                    and any content-related questions is the
                    `<code>#learninganalytics</code> Slack channel. The
                    instructor and course assistant, as well as other
                    students and alums monitor this channel and often
                    provide immediate support. You are encouraged to
                    contact the instructors at any time via email or
                    direct message on Slack.</p>
                    <p><strong>Online tools:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p><em>Moodle:</em> will be used to post the
                    syllabus and links to weekly readings, videos, and
                    discussions.</p></li>
                    <li><p><em>Slack:</em> will be our main channel for
                    online communications. Please Join our Slack team
                    with your Adelphi email. If you run into trouble or
                    have a question, post it here to our channel,
                    `<code>#learninganalytics</code>, or send a message
                    to <code>@mxc</code> or <code>@aaronhung</code>.
                    During the weeks of the class, we recommend running
                    the Slack app for you phone.</p></li>
                    <li><p><em>mail.adelphi.edu email:</em> we will use
                    your official adelphi student email for class email
                    communications as well as the associated google
                    account for video/audio chats and calendar events.
                    Please check this email regularly.</p></li>

<h2>The Center for Academic Support and Enrichment (CASE; formerly The Learning and Writing Centers)</h2>
<p>
CASE programs and services--like individual tutoring in writing and subjects across the
curriculum, small group study sessions, academic coaching, and targeted workshops--help
students explore, deepen, and extend their classroom learning. Support programming focuses
on establishing foundational skills and techniques of studentship, like time management and
note-taking. Enrichment services develop higher-order critical thinking skills and problem solving
skills inherent in both abstractions and applications of curricular study. 
</p>

<h2>The Adelphi Honor Code</h2>
<p>
  The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to
  this pursuit is academic integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s
  Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to uphold the principles of honesty and civility
  embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth and honesty and I will
  forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h3>Code of Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying,
cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation
  marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to
  produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized
  collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is
  plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-
  generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of
  plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as
  ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or
  otherwise) for student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are,
  please reach out to me to discuss it as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic
  integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review and could result in
  disciplinary action. <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty</a>.
</p>

<h2>Diversity statement</h2>
We value human dignity and diversity in all forms, embrace our differences, and honor all
voices. We understand the collective power inherent in fully inclusive communities where each
may meet their full potential to contribute.


<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that
the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and
students are strongly encouraged to respond. Please be assured that your responses are
anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after course grades have
been submitted after the semester ends.

<h2>Religious observance policy</h2>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious
observances. Students who anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are
required by Adelphi University to notify their professors at the start of the semester. This will
allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their course exam and
assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on
those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment
deadline missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out
suitable arrangements for make-ups or other satisfaction of academic requirements.
