                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> From a foundation
                    of computer networks and systems, this course
                    expands to cover instructional technology
                    infrastructure: file systems, users, wired and
                    wireless networks, email, web servers, computer
                    labs, and common educational software services. This
                    course focuses on Free Software; where the source
                    code is free to use, study, or modify. To explore
                    these topics in this hands on class all students
                    will be configuring their own Raspberry Pi computers
                    and using them to complete a software/hardware
                    project.</p>

                    <p>This online course will have a mix of synchronous
                    and asynchronous assignments. The synchronous
                    sessions, “live lab,” will be held each Wednesday,
                    via Zoom, 4:30pm to 6:20pm.</p>
                    <p>Participants in this course must actively
                    participate in our suite of online communications
                    tools, including Slack (<a

                    email, and the course website.</p>
                    <p>You <em>must</em> check your Adelphi email and
                    the <code>#code</code> channel on Slack <strong>at
                    least once a day during this short summer
                    course.</strong> It is highly recommended that you
                    install the Slack mobile client and an email client
                    on your mobile phone so that you receive “push
                    notifications” of course announcements.</p>
                    <p>The best place to post general course questions
                    and any content-related questions is the
                    <code>#code</code> Slack channel. The instructor, as
                    well as other students and alums, monitor this
                    channel and often provide immediate support. You are
                    encouraged to contact the instructors at any time
                    via email or direct message on Slack.</p>

                    help should be #code on Slack. You are most likely
                    to get quick help if you post here because anyone in
                    the channel (instructors, other students, other
                    faculty, ed tech alums) can lend a hand.</p>

                    <p>Because this is a short summer course (3 credits
                    in 6 weeks), you should budget 10-15 hours each week
                    for course work. Wednesday live lab sessions are
                    required, but you will also spend significant time
                    working through course materials at your own
                    pace.</p>
                    <p>Your participation grade will consider
                    preparation for live labs, timely management of your
                    Trello projects, completion of the comprehension
                    quizzes, and participation in Slack and Moodle
                    discussions. Smaller (ungraded) weekly assignments
                    will also be considered for your participation
                    grade. You may earn bonus participation points if
                    you go “above and beyond” in a week, especially by
                    providing help or making full use of our classroom

                    <p>Working in a team of 3, you will be responsible
                    for designing a 15 question quiz (via Google Forms)
                    to check the basic understanding of the videos and
                    readings for the week. The quizzes should consist of
                    multiple choice (one answer or multiple “all that
                    apply”) questions that can be automatically scored.
                    You must provide a detailed answer key for every
                    question. The questions should not be overly
                    challenging, but should be based on the readings
                    (not general knowledge). Anyone who carefully
                    completes the readings should be able to score 13/15
                    points or better.</p>
                    <p>Quizzes are <strong>ungraded</strong> for the

                    <ul>
                    <li><em>coverage:</em> did the quiz cover all of the
                    big ideas in the readings?</li>
                    <li><em>depth:</em> are the questions challenging
                    without being tricks or requiring detailed synthesis
                    of the materials? do they avoid being to specific or
                    two general?</li>
                    <li><em>explanations:</em> do the answer keys for
                    each questions appropariately explain the correct
                    and incorrect answers?</li>

                    <h2>Web Software Project</h2>
                    <p>For the first project, you will install the <a
                    href="https://ubuntu.org">Ubuntu</a> OS as a
                    <em>guest</em> operating system on your computer.
                    You will use Ubuntu to configure a server running
                    one of the following popular web-based software
                    systems:</p>
                    <ol type="1">

                    </ol>
                    <p>Once you have the software installed, you will
                    customize it for a specific use (that you decide).
                    For example, you might configure WordPress as a
                    classroom website, Moodle to support a summer
                    course, or Ghost to host a personal newsletter or

                    <p><em>Submission Guidelines</em></p>
                    <p>To submit this project, you will upload a
                    narrated screencast video of your project to
                    VoiceThread (you can sign in with your Adelphi email
                    account). If you do not want the video to be public,
                    change the permissions so that it is an “unlisted”
                    video. Only people with the link will be able to see
                    it. Create a new thread in the discussion forum with

                    video here, along with any supporting documentation
                    (screenshots, code, config files).</p>
                    <p>Begin the video with a description of who the
                    target users are of this software and what your
                    goals are for them. Next, show your project from the
                    user’s perspective, showing how it meets the needs
                    of the use cases that guided you in designing the
                    project. Next, you can, if appropriate, give a brief
                    tour of the configuration files and scripts that
                    make your project possible. Your video should be 5-6

                    <p>One of the key technical tasks of an educational
                    technologist or instructional designer is to
                    research and evaluate possible solutions to a
                    problem and then implement a plan to test a possible
                    solution. Real world problems often require the
                    combination of several systems in a new way, suffer
                    from incomplete or inaccurate documentation, and are
                    hindered by time or resources/financial
                    constraints.</p>
                    <p>With this in mind, you will choose a software
                    project that you find interesting and engaging to
                    pursue for your final project. You will be
                    responsible for gathering/purchasing the materials
                    to complete the project.</p>
                    <p>You will be evaluated on:</p>

                    <li>skill with the linux operating system</li>
                    <li>ability to customize your solution to meet the
                    project’s goals</li>

                    on the same project. You will share a Trello and set
                    goals together. It will be up to you to decide who

                    can do for your final project.</p>

                    class="uri">https://mycroft.ai</a><br> MyCroft is a
                    Free Software alternative to systems such as Alexa
                    and Google Assistant. MyCroft is developed for
                    Linux. It requires some attention to details to get
                    all of the media components working properly. For
                    this project, you will download and configure
                    MyCroft for your VM; create and connect to your
                    online account, configure and test the microphone
                    and audio output, and customize the features and
                    functionality of your RPI assistant. Start at the <a
                    href="https://mycroft.ai">mycroft site</a> for all
                    of the information you need to get started.</li>

                    Hub is a collaborative version of the Jupyter
                    Notebook software development environment. Set up a
                    Jupyter Hub installation on your VM and configure it
                    for use in a programming, math, or other learning
                    environment that requires a shared coding
                    environment.</li>

                    While you <em>had</em> to set up a basic version of
                    these systems for the first project, they are
                    complex softare systems with many templates,
                    plug-ins, and customizations. Your team may choose
                    to work on one of these to create a more complete
                    website.</li>

                    Mattermost is a FOSS chat sever (similar to Slack)
                    that you can host on your own sever for privacy and

                    The magic mirror or smart mirror runs a customizable
                    web server that serves as a digital kiosk (and, if
                    desired, a magic mirror – a mirrored LCD monitor).

                    a server (e.g. Node or Python) and create an “app”
                    that interacts, automatically, with Slack chat.</li>

                    <p><em>Submission Guidelines</em></p>
                    <p>To submit this project, you will upload a
                    narrated screencast video of your project to
                    VoiceThread. Begin the video with a description of
                    who the target users are of this setup and what your
                    goals are for them. Next, show your project from the
                    user’s perspective, showing how it meets the needs
                    of the use cases that guided you in designing the
                    project. Next, you can, if appropriate, give a brief
                    tour of the configuration files and scripts that
                    make your project possible. Your video should be
                    8-10 minutes long. Submit one video per team.</p>

                    <h2>Week 2: The Command Line</h2>
                    <p>This week we will learn how to interact with our
                    computer using the command line (aka terminal). The
                    command line interface (CLI) offers an alternative
                    to the graphical user interface (GUI) we are more
                    familiar with. Wile the terminal hearkens back to
                    the early days of computing, its still very much
                    alive for systems administrators, software
                    developers, and others. In particular, complex tasks
                    can be accomplished with a few lines of text, remote
                    computers can be easily accessed, and all manner of
                    tasks can be automated (and scheduled).
                    Specifically, after gaining fluency with the command
                    line, you will be able to connect to a remote Linux
                    server from your regular laptop or desktop computer
                    in order to configure and control it. To get started
                    on the command line we’ll check out Terminus, a game
                    developed at MIT to introduce the players to the
                    command line.</p>
                    <p>In addition to jumping into the command line, by
                    the end of the week you will have customized your VM
                    by installing software packages through
                    <code>apt</code> and the GUI. You will also choose
                    your topic for the first project and set up a Trello
                    with a Board for your project and milestones for
                    each week until it’s due.</p>

                    <p>As you’re working on finishing up your first
                    project, we’ll take a deeper look at how files,
                    permissions and security works in linux/unix
                    operating systems. To better understand how to work
                    with files, we’ll take a look at file archives
                    (multiple files and directories combined in a single
                    file) and compression (reducing the size of a file).
                    Because your programs all run as a “user” (either
                    root or their own user), it’s important to
                    understand files and permissions to troubleshoot

                    <h3>Networking Topic Report Instructions</h3>
                    <p>For a more in-depth look at networking, you will
                    work with a partner to write a mini report on a
                    related topic. Please: a) choose a partner, and b)
                    choose a topic from the list below. If you have an
                    idea for a different topic, you may write about that
                    with approval from the instructors. By the end of
                    the week, please post your report directly into our
                    <em>Networking Topics</em> forum. Your report should
                    be roughly 500-800 words. It should give an overview
                    of the topic, summary of how it works, and
                    discussion of how it’s used and why it is (or isn’t)
                    important. Read through the other posts, and ask any
                    follow-up questions. The instructor and topic
                    authors will do their best to answer your
                    questions.</p>

                    responsibility. We trust the people who run our
                    networks to keep our information safe, and to not
                    violate our trust while they do it. Along the way,
                    they may face some hard choices, usually weighing
                    the benefits of individuals versus the group. We’ll
                    take a look at some of the ethical concerns in “big
                    tech”, and also investigate how these same concerns
                    appear in the context of schools and other

<h2>The Center for Academic Support and Enrichment (CASE; formerly The Learning and Writing Centers)</h2>
<p>
CASE programs and services--like individual tutoring in writing and subjects across the
curriculum, small group study sessions, academic coaching, and targeted workshops--help
students explore, deepen, and extend their classroom learning. Support programming focuses
on establishing foundational skills and techniques of studentship, like time management and
note-taking. Enrichment services develop higher-order critical thinking skills and problem solving
skills inherent in both abstractions and applications of curricular study.

  The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to
  this pursuit is academic integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s
  Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to uphold the principles of honesty and civility
  embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth and honesty and I will
  forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h3>Code of Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying,
cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation
  marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to
  produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized
  collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is
  plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-
  generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of
  plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as
  ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or
  otherwise) for student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are,
  please reach out to me to discuss it as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic
  integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review and could result in
  disciplinary action. <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty</a>.
</p>

<h2>Diversity statement</h2>
We value human dignity and diversity in all forms, embrace our differences, and honor all
voices. We understand the collective power inherent in fully inclusive communities where each
may meet their full potential to contribute.


<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that
the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and
students are strongly encouraged to respond. Please be assured that your responses are
anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after course grades have
been submitted after the semester ends.

<h2>Religious observance policy</h2>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious
observances. Students who anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are
required by Adelphi University to notify their professors at the start of the semester. This will
allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their course exam and
assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on
those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment
deadline missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out
suitable arrangements for make-ups or other satisfaction of academic requirements.
