<p><strong>0858-618, Spring 2013</strong></p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> social media, social software, educational technology,
social networks, online learning, informal learning</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Social media pervades our social life; with implications
for education, business and beyond. Examine the sociological and

their use in classrooms to build community, develop literacy, and foster
critical thinking.</p>

that has made its way into life of the individual as well as education,
business and medicine. Since this technology has become an important
part of society and because it can facilitate social interactions where
people can connect and share thoughts, opinions, special interests and
personal information, it has great potential for teaching and learning.
Educators must have knowledge of this technology and understand it’s
sociological and psychological impacts, social benefits, privacy and
security risks and potential applications for education.</p>
