                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>The technology practicum focuses on the
                    integrated, team-based development of educational
                    technology. Student-teams partner with businesses,
                    non-profits, schools, or universities to develop and
                    deploy an educational technology solution. This
                    course focuses on interdisciplinary, team
                    approaches; students will fill two of the following
                    roles during the course of the semester:
                    instructional designer, technologist (coder/network
                    admin), project manager, creative director.</p>
                    <p>This course is designed as a practicum for
                    Masters students who are not enrolled in the New
                    York State certification track and who choose not to
                    take EDT 801 (the K-12 practicum). Students will
                    gain real-world experience working as part of a
                    multidiscplinary team developing interactive
                    educational media. They will learn the tools and
                    techniques of expert software development teams
                    while building their professional portfolio.</p>
                    <p>The main goal of this course is for students to
                    implement and extend their skills as part of a
                    “professional” educational technology team. As a
                    field-based course, they will work with real
                    instructional designers, media producers, and
                    software developers in the field.</p>
                    <p>Students will learn:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>technical project management of
                    interdisciplinary teams</li>
                    <li>software development methodologies, with a focus
                    on lightweight/agile methodologies</li>
                    <li>client interaction</li>
                    <li>iterative software planning and development</li>
                    <li>rapid prototyping</li>
                    <li>usability testing and quality assurance</li>
                    <li>distributed/collaborative tools for virtual
                    software and media development (things like git,
                    trak, irc or whatever else the kids are using at the
                    time)</li>

<h2>The Center for Academic Support and Enrichment (CASE; formerly The Learning and Writing Centers)</h2>
<p>
CASE programs and services--like individual tutoring in writing and subjects across the
curriculum, small group study sessions, academic coaching, and targeted workshops--help
students explore, deepen, and extend their classroom learning. Support programming focuses
on establishing foundational skills and techniques of studentship, like time management and
note-taking. Enrichment services develop higher-order critical thinking skills and problem solving
skills inherent in both abstractions and applications of curricular study. 
</p>

<h2>The Adelphi Honor Code</h2>
<p>
  The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to
  this pursuit is academic integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s
  Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to uphold the principles of honesty and civility
  embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth and honesty and I will
  forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h3>Code of Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying,
cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation
  marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to
  produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized
  collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is
  plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-
  generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of
  plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as
  ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or
  otherwise) for student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are,
  please reach out to me to discuss it as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic
  integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review and could result in
  disciplinary action. <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty</a>.
</p>

<h2>Diversity statement</h2>
We value human dignity and diversity in all forms, embrace our differences, and honor all
voices. We understand the collective power inherent in fully inclusive communities where each
may meet their full potential to contribute.


<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that
the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and
students are strongly encouraged to respond. Please be assured that your responses are
anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after course grades have
been submitted after the semester ends.

<h2>Religious observance policy</h2>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious
observances. Students who anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are
required by Adelphi University to notify their professors at the start of the semester. This will
allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their course exam and
assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on
those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment
deadline missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out
suitable arrangements for make-ups or other satisfaction of academic requirements.
