**Description:** From a foundation of computer networks and systems, this course
expands to cover instructional technology infrastructure: file systems, users,
wired and wireless networks, email, web servers, computer labs, and common educational
software services. This course focuses on Free Software; where the source code
is free to use, study, or modify. To explore these topics in this hands on class
all students will be configuring their own Raspberry Pi computers and using them
to complete a software/hardware project.

<h1 id="class-information">Class Information</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Instructor:</strong> Matt Curinga <a href="mailto:mcuringa@adelphi.edu">mcuringa@adelphi.edu</a></li>
  <li><strong>Class dates:</strong> Wednesday, May 26 - Tuesday, June 29</li>
  <li><strong>Live sessions:</strong> Wednesdays: 4:30pm - 6:20pm; <small>zoom link on moodle</small></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="course-communications">Course Communications</h1>

<p>This online course will have a mix of synchronous and asynchronous assignments.
The synchronous sessions, “live lab,” will be held each Wednesday, via Zoom,
4:30pm to 6:20pm.</p>

<p>Participants in this course must actively participate in our suite of online
communications tools, including Slack (<a href="https://auedtech.slack.com">https://auedtech.slack.com</a>),
Adelphi email, and the course website.</p>

<p>You <em>must</em> check your Adelphi email and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#raspberrypi</code> channel on Slack <strong>at least
once a day.</strong> It is highly recommended that you install the Slack mobile client
and an email client on your mobile phone so that you receive “push notifications”
of course announcements.</p>

<p>The best place to post general course questions and any content-related questions
is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#raspberrypi</code> Slack channel. The instructor, as well
as other students and alums, monitor this channel and often provide immediate support.
You are encouraged to contact the instructors at any time via email or direct
message on Slack.</p>

<h3 id="online-tools">Online tools:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Moodle:</strong> will be used to post the syllabus and links to weekly readings, videos, and discussions.</li>
  <li><strong>Slack:</strong> will be our main channel for online communications.
Please <a href="https://auedtech.slack.com/signup">Join our Slack team with your Adelphi email</a>.
If you run into trouble or have a question, post it here to our channel, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#raspberrypi</code>,
or send a message to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@mxc</code>. During the weeks of the class, we recommend running
the Slack app for you phone.</li>
  <li><strong>Trello:</strong> is project management software that you will use to track/plan
your two projects, and to share your progress with the course instructors.
Create a <a href="https://trello.com/signup">Trello Account</a> before the first week of
class, and (optionally) <a href="https://trello.com/platforms">install the mobile app</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>mail.adelphi.edu email:</strong> we will use your official adelphi student email
for class email communications. Please check this email regularly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="getting-remote-help">Getting remote help:</h3>

<p>Because of the hands on nature of working with computers and Raspberry Pi, you
will have to use a variety of tools to get help. Your first stop for help should
be #raspberrypi on Slack. You are most likely to get quick help if you post here
because anyone in the channel (instructors, other students, other faculty, ed tech alums)
can lend a hand.</p>

<p>For more complicated problems, you will need to be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages">post formatted code in slack</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ScreenShots#Using_Gnome">take a screenshot from your RPI</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/7290345?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">create a google hangout/meeting with screensharing</a></li>
  <li>enable remote access to instructors to your RPI via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> – at the end of the
first week, you should have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> enabled on your Pi. To enable remote access
you will probably have to enable Network Address Translation (NAT) on your wifi router.
If you are on public wifi (e.g. school, library, coffee shop), you probably won’t
be able to enable remote access. NAT is not hard to configure, but it’s specific
to the wifi router that you’re using. You will have to search
“configure network address translation” along with your router make and model.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/">connect to your RPI with VNC</a>
(once you’re comfortable with NAT, you can also configure NAT for VNC if needed)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="required-books">Required Books</h1>
<p><em>None</em></p>

<h1 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h1>

<h2 id="desktoplaptop">Desktop/Laptop</h2>
<p>You must have access to a desktop computer running Linux, Windows, or MacOS to
participate in this course. You will use this computer to participate in the
course online and to configure and connect or your RPI. You can use a phone
or tablet for some online elements of the course, however you will not be able
to complete course assignments without access to a computer where you are able
to install software.</p>

<p>In addition to the computer, you must have a webcam, headphones, and microphone
to participate in live video chat and to record your screencasts.</p>

<h2 id="raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>Every student <em>must</em> purchase a Raspberry Pi (RPI) computer and accessories
for use in this course. You will keep your own hardware. If you already own a
Raspberry Pi, of course you can use it for this course. You can pick up these
items in person at a local <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/">MicroCenter</a> (<a href="https://account.microcenter.com/PublicWishList.aspx?WishListID=4Yt4PUuytCb2roLGPinnTH5Itg3JsOKt&amp;Email=SXkm0QpXuD%2b%2fxxyZcAguSK2mIABUJbA7">view items in wishlist</a>) or purchase them online.</p>

<p>Required hardware:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raspberry Pi model 4 (2GB model recommended): [<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15446">SparkFun</a>] [<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Model-2019-Quad-Bluetooth/dp/B07TD42S27">Amazon</a>] [<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4295">AdaFruit</a>]</li>

  <li>micro SD card reader: these are built into many modern laptop and some desktops, but any card reader/writer that works with your computer (USB 2, USB 3, USB-C) will work. You should be able to find one for less than $10 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BBX4YM1/">Amazon</a> or in a local store (Staples, Best Buy, Microcenter).</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need (but can re-use existing):</p>

<ul>
  <li>USB Keyboard and Mouse [<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014EUQOGK/">wireless</a>] [<a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/485045/inland-ic-210-premium-mouse-keyboard-combo">wired</a>]</li>
  <li>Computer Monitor or TV with HDMI input</li>
</ul>

<p><em>You must have all of the required hardware ### before the first week of class.</em></p>

<p>If you purchased everything except the monitor it would cost $80-$90.</p>

<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>Because this is a short summer course (3 credits in 6 weeks), you should budget
10-15 hours each week for course work. Wednesday live lab sessions are required,
but you will also spend significant time working through course materials at your
own pace.</p>

<p>Your participation grade will consider preparation for live labs, timely
management of your Trello projects, and participation in Slack and Moodle
discussions. Smaller (ungraded) weekly assignments will also be considered for
your participation grade.</p>

<h2 id="rpi-client-or-server-setup">RPI Client or Server Setup</h2>
<p>For our first project you will configure your Raspberry Pi for a specific
educational scenario: a general computer for 4th grade classroom computer
station, a setup to teach computer programming for kids, a development server
for the Canvas LMS, a workstation configured with assistive technology to support
users with different physical needs, a web server to host static HTML/Javascript projects,
a managed computer lab setup, etc. Whatever scenario you choose, your installation
should be precisely tailored to meet the needs of your target users.</p>

<p>You will present your project as a narrated screencast. In addition to demonstrating the
software, you will upload a report which details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a description of the target audience and how you envision they would use the RPI</li>
  <li>the process you used to find, test, and configure the RPI</li>
  <li>key features of the software installed</li>
  <li>advantages, disadvantages, and other implications of your design</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be evaluated on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>demonstration of your understanding of RPI hardware and software</li>
  <li>suitability of your solution for your stated audience/problem</li>
  <li>risk/complexity of the task undertaken</li>
  <li>reflection on the process</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Submission Guidelines</em></p>

<p>To submit this project, you will upload a narrated screencast video of your
project to YouTube (you can sign in with your Adelphi email account). If you do
not want the video to be public, change the permissions so that it is an
“unlisted” video. Only people with the link will be able to see it. Create a new
thread in the discussion forum with a title for your project. Post the link to
your video here, along with any supporting documentation (screenshots, code,
config files).</p>

<p>Begin the video with a description of who the target users are of this setup and
what your goals are for them. Next, show your project from the user’s
perspective, showing how it meets the needs  of the use cases that guided you in
designing the project. Next, you can, if appropriate, give a brief tour of the
configuration files and scripts that make your project possible. Your video
should be 5-10 minutes long.</p>

<p>Please take time to watch your classmate’s videos and post comments, questions,
and suggestions.</p>

<p><em>This is an individual project.</em></p>

<h2 id="diy-project">DIY Project</h2>
<p>One of the key technical tasks of an educational technologist or instructional
designer is to research and evaluate possible solutions to a problem and then
implement a plan to test a possible solution. Real world problems often require
the combination of several systems in a new way, suffer from incomplete or
inaccurate documentation, and are hindered by time or resources/financial
constraints.</p>

<p>With this in mind, you will choose an RPI project that you find interesting and
engaging to pursue for your final project. You will be responsible for
gathering/purchasing the materials to complete the project.</p>

<p>You will be evaluated on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>skill with RPI hardware</li>
  <li>skill with RPI software</li>
  <li>creativity of the project chosen</li>
  <li>risk/scope of the project</li>
  <li>reflection on the process</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a <em>paired project.</em> You and a partner of your choice will work on the
same project. You will share a Trello and set goals together, however you will
both complete the project independently and will receive an individual grade.
Your partner will serve as a resource for planning and troubleshooting problems
that arise during the course of the project.</p>

<p>With the instructors’ permission, you may work on this project individually.</p>

<p>Here are a few raspberry pi project ideas that will give you a sense of the size and
scope of what you can do for your final project.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>MyCroft Open Source personal assistant</strong><br />
<a href="https://mycroft.ai">https://mycroft.ai</a><br />
MyCroft is a Free Software alternative to systems such as Alexa and Google Assistant.
While it runs on a regular desktop computer, it was designed to work on a RPI.
You can download a pre-configured SD Card image to get started with “PiCroft”.
For this project, you will download and configure MyCroft for your Pi; create
and connect to your online account, configure and test the microphone and audio
output, and customize the features and functionality of your RPI assistant.
Start at the <a href="https://mycroft.ai">mycroft site</a> for all of the information you need to get started.</li>
  <li><strong>RetroPi Arcade Console</strong><br />
<a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">https://retropie.org.uk/</a><br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.hanahaki.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/arcade-bartop-raspberry-pi-retropie-mame-2018-diy-tutorial-guide.png?fit=735%2C458&amp;ssl=1" alt="old school arcade games made with retropi" class="img-fluid d-block" />
Do you think that Fortnite has nothing on the original Streetfighter? That
Assassin’s Creed pales in the glow of Golden Eye? Or do you just want to play
the Super Mario Bros, the greatest video game of all time? Turn your RPI into
a video game emulator that can play the classics made for Artari, Nintendo NES, Sega,
and more. Once you’ve got the general system up and running, you can add some
custom controllers and make it an upright arcade.</li>
  <li><strong>Raspberry Pi Light Show</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/christmas-lights/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/christmas-lights/</a> &amp; <a href="https://opensource.com/life/15/2/music-light-show-with-raspberry-pi">https://opensource.com/life/15/2/music-light-show-with-raspberry-pi</a><br />
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Kci9K2E4fsvaqymZvO/giphy.gif" alt="very flash xmas light show" class="img-fluid d-block" />
Want to turn your classroom into a disco or put your neighbors to shame this
Halloween or Christmas? Even if you don’t, you should
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?embed=0&amp;v=90oZ52M4IC0">check out this sick RPI Christmas display</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Mini Creature Home</strong><br />
<a href="https://allenheard.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/making-a-mini-beast-habitat-raspberry-pi-style/">https://allenheard.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/making-a-mini-beast-habitat-raspberry-pi-style/</a><br />
Create an ant or snail home, complete with a live webcam. This project should
give you lots of ideas if your looking for STEAM projects for younger kids.</li>
  <li><strong>MagicMirror</strong><br />
<a href="https://magicmirror.builders/">https://magicmirror.builders/</a><br />
The magic mirror or smart mirror is an RPI favorite: put a reflective coating
or 2-way mirrored plexiglass over an old monitor or TV, hook it up to your Pi, and
throw up you daily calendar, the bus schedule, weather, news, poetry, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Digital (Pi)cture Frame</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/showerthoughts-earthporn-make-inspiring-raspberry-pi-photo-frame/">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/showerthoughts-earthporn-make-inspiring-raspberry-pi-photo-frame/</a><br />
If the <em>mirror</em> seems like it might be too much, how about a digital picture frame?</li>
</ol>

<p>These are just a few of the many possible projects. You may conceive of your
own project, or check out some of these other ideas:</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="week-2-the-command-line">Week 2: The Command Line</h2>
<p>This week we will learn how to interact with our computer using the command line
(aka terminal). The command line interface (CLI) offers an alternative to the
graphical user interface (GUI) we are more familiar with. Wile the terminal
hearkens back to the early days of computing, its still very much alive for
systems administrators, software developers, and others. In particular, complex
tasks can be accomplished with a few lines of text, remote computers can be
easily accessed, and all manner of tasks can be automated (and scheduled).
Specifically, after gaining fluency with the command line, you will be able to
log into your RPI from your regular laptop or desktop computer in order to
configure and control it. To get started on the command line we’ll check out
Terminus, a game developed at MIT to introduce the players to the command line.</p>

<p>In addition to jumping into the command line, by the end of the week you will
have customized your RPI by installing software packages through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt</code> and the
GUI. You will also choose your topic for the first project and set up a Trello
with a Board for your project and milestones for each week until it’s due.</p>

<h2 id="week-3-users-groups-files--permissions">Week 3: Users, Groups, Files, &amp; Permissions</h2>
<p>As you’re working on finishing up your first RPI project, we’ll take a deeper
look at how files, permissions and security works on RPI and in linux/unix operating
systems generally. To better understand how to work with files, we’ll take a look
at file archives (multiple files and directories combined in a single file) and
compression (reducing the size of a file). Because your programs all run as a
“user” (either root or their own user), it’s important to understand files and
permissions to troubleshoot problems.</p>

<h3 id="guiding-questions-2">Guiding Questions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>How do you secure digital resources?</li>
  <li>Is the unix approach of users and groups sufficient for all security needs?</li>

<p>For a more in-depth look at networking, you will work with a partner to write
a mini report on a related topic. Please: a) choose a partner, and b) choose a
topic from the list below. If you have an idea for a different topic, you may
write about that with approval from the instructors. By the end of the week,
please post your report directly into our <em>Networking Topics</em> forum. Your report
should be roughly 500-800 words. It should give an overview of the topic,
summary of how it works, and discussion of how it’s used and why it is (or
isn’t) important. Read through the other posts, and ask any follow-up questions.
The instructor and topic authors will do their best to answer your questions.</p>

<p>Possible topics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bluetooth</li>
  <li>Mesh network</li>
  <li>Near Field Communication (NFC)</li>

<h2 id="week-5-ethics">Week 5: Ethics</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/17610/spider-man_with_great_power._2008_1">As Spider-Man learned</a>,
with great power comes great responsibility. We trust the people who run our
networks to keep our information safe, and to not violate our trust while they
do it. Along the way, they may face some hard choices, usually weighing the benefits
of individuals versus the group. We’ll take a look at some of the ethical concerns
in “big tech”, and also investigate how these same concerns appear in the context
of schools and other educational institutions.</p>

<h3 id="guiding-questions-4">Guiding Questions:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>How do school systems balance student privacy and autonomy, with safety and learning efficiency?</li>
  <li>What are the key ethical concerns of embedding corporate interests (and technology) into public spaces like schools?</li>
</ol>
