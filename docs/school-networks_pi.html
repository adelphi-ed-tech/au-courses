                    <h1>Course Communications</h1>
                    <p>This online course will have a mix of synchronous and asynchronous assignments. The synchronous sessions, “live lab,” will be held each Wednesday, via Zoom, 4:30pm to 6:20pm.</p>
                    <p>Participants in this course must actively participate in our suite of online communications tools, including Slack (<a href="https://auedtech.slack.com" class="uri">https://auedtech.slack.com</a>), Adelphi email, and the course website.</p>
                    <p>You <em>must</em> check your Adelphi email and the <code>#raspberrypi</code> channel on Slack <strong>at least once a day.</strong> It is highly recommended that you install the Slack mobile client and an email client on your mobile phone so that you receive “push notifications” of course announcements.</p>
                    <p>The best place to post general course questions and any content-related questions is the <code>#raspberrypi</code> Slack channel. The instructor, as well as other students and alums, monitor this channel and often provide immediate support. You are encouraged to contact the instructors at any time via email or direct message on Slack.</p>
                    <section id="online-tools" class="level3">
                    <h3>Online tools:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Moodle:</strong> will be used to post the syllabus and links to weekly readings, videos, and discussions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slack:</strong> will be our main channel for online communications. Please <a href="https://auedtech.slack.com/signup">Join our Slack team with your Adelphi email</a>. If you run into trouble or have a question, post it here to our channel, <code>#raspberrypi</code>, or send a message to <code>@mxc</code>. During the weeks of the class, we recommend running the Slack app for you phone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trello:</strong> is project management software that you will use to track/plan your two projects, and to share your progress with the course instructors. Create a <a href="https://trello.com/signup">Trello Account</a> before the first week of class, and (optionally) <a href="https://trello.com/platforms">install the mobile app</a>.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>mail.adelphi.edu email:</strong> we will use your official adelphi student email for class email communications. Please check this email regularly.</li>

                    <h3>Getting remote help:</h3>
                    <p>Because of the hands on nature of working with computers and Raspberry Pi, you will have to use a variety of tools to get help. Your first stop for help should be #raspberrypi on Slack. You are most likely to get quick help if you post here because anyone in the channel (instructors, other students, other faculty, ed tech alums) can lend a hand.</p>
                    <p>For more complicated problems, you will need to be able to:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages">post formatted code in slack</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ScreenShots#Using_Gnome">take a screenshot from your RPI</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/7290345?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">create a google hangout/meeting with screensharing</a></li>
                    <li>enable remote access to instructors to your RPI via <code>ssh</code> – at the end of the first week, you should have <code>ssh</code> enabled on your Pi. To enable remote access you will probably have to enable Network Address Translation (NAT) on your wifi router. If you are on public wifi (e.g. school, library, coffee shop), you probably won’t be able to enable remote access. NAT is not hard to configure, but it’s specific to the wifi router that you’re using. You will have to search “configure network address translation” along with your router make and model.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/">connect to your RPI with VNC</a> (once you’re comfortable with NAT, you can also configure NAT for VNC if needed)</li>

                    <h2>Participation</h2>
                    <p>Because this is a short summer course (3 credits in 6 weeks), you should budget 10-15 hours each week for course work. Wednesday live lab sessions are required, but you will also spend significant time working through course materials at your own pace.</p>
                    <p>Your participation grade will consider preparation for live labs, timely management of your Trello projects, and participation in Slack and Moodle discussions. Smaller (ungraded) weekly assignments will also be considered for your participation grade.</p>

                    <h2>RPI Client or Server Setup</h2>
                    <p>For our first project you will configure your Raspberry Pi for a specific educational scenario: a general computer for 4th grade classroom computer station, a setup to teach computer programming for kids, a development server for the Canvas LMS, a workstation configured with assistive technology to support users with different physical needs, a web server to host static HTML/Javascript projects, a managed computer lab setup, etc. Whatever scenario you choose, your installation should be precisely tailored to meet the needs of your target users.</p>
                    <p>You will present your project as a narrated screencast. In addition to demonstrating the software, you will upload a report which details:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>a description of the target audience and how you envision they would use the RPI</li>
                    <li>the process you used to find, test, and configure the RPI</li>
                    <li>key features of the software installed</li>
                    <li>advantages, disadvantages, and other implications of your design</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You will be evaluated on:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>demonstration of your understanding of RPI hardware and software</li>
                    <li>suitability of your solution for your stated audience/problem</li>
                    <li>risk/complexity of the task undertaken</li>

                    <p><em>Submission Guidelines</em></p>
                    <p>To submit this project, you will upload a narrated screencast video of your project to YouTube (you can sign in with your Adelphi email account). If you do not want the video to be public, change the permissions so that it is an “unlisted” video. Only people with the link will be able to see it. Create a new thread in the discussion forum with a title for your project. Post the link to your video here, along with any supporting documentation (screenshots, code, config files).</p>
                    <p>Begin the video with a description of who the target users are of this setup and what your goals are for them. Next, show your project from the user’s perspective, showing how it meets the needs of the use cases that guided you in designing the project. Next, you can, if appropriate, give a brief tour of the configuration files and scripts that make your project possible. Your video should be 5-10 minutes long.</p>
                    <p>Please take time to watch your classmate’s videos and post comments, questions, and suggestions.</p>

                    <h2>DIY Project</h2>
                    <p>One of the key technical tasks of an educational technologist or instructional designer is to research and evaluate possible solutions to a problem and then implement a plan to test a possible solution. Real world problems often require the combination of several systems in a new way, suffer from incomplete or inaccurate documentation, and are hindered by time or resources/financial constraints.</p>
                    <p>With this in mind, you will choose an RPI project that you find interesting and engaging to pursue for your final project. You will be responsible for gathering/purchasing the materials to complete the project.</p>
                    <p>You will be evaluated on:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>skill with RPI hardware</li>
                    <li>skill with RPI software</li>
                    <li>creativity of the project chosen</li>
                    <li>risk/scope of the project</li>
                    <li>reflection on the process</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This is a <em>paired project.</em> You and a partner of your choice will work on the same project. You will share a Trello and set goals together, however you will both complete the project independently and will receive an individual grade. Your partner will serve as a resource for planning and troubleshooting problems that arise during the course of the project.</p>
                    <p>With the instructors’ permission, you may work on this project individually.</p>
                    <p>Here are a few raspberry pi project ideas that will give you a sense of the size and scope of what you can do for your final project.</p>

                    <li><strong>MyCroft Open Source personal assistant</strong><br> <a href="https://mycroft.ai" class="uri">https://mycroft.ai</a><br> MyCroft is a Free Software alternative to systems such as Alexa and Google Assistant. While it runs on a regular desktop computer, it was designed to work on a RPI. You can download a pre-configured SD Card image to get started with “PiCroft”. For this project, you will download and configure MyCroft for your Pi; create and connect to your online account, configure and test the microphone and audio output, and customize the features and functionality of your RPI assistant. Start at the <a href="https://mycroft.ai">mycroft site</a> for all of the information you need to get started.</li>

That Assassin’s Creed pales in the glow of Golden Eye? Or do you just want to play the Super Mario Bros, the greatest video game of all time? Turn your RPI into a video game emulator that can play the classics made for Artari, Nintendo NES, Sega, and more. Once you’ve got the general system up and running, you can add some custom controllers and make it an upright arcade.<br />

                    <h2>Week 2: The Command Line</h2>
                    <p>This week we will learn how to interact with our computer using the command line (aka terminal). The command line interface (CLI) offers an alternative to the graphical user interface (GUI) we are more familiar with. Wile the terminal hearkens back to the early days of computing, its still very much alive for systems administrators, software developers, and others. In particular, complex tasks can be accomplished with a few lines of text, remote computers can be easily accessed, and all manner of tasks can be automated (and scheduled). Specifically, after gaining fluency with the command line, you will be able to log into your RPI from your regular laptop or desktop computer in order to configure and control it. To get started on the command line we’ll check out Terminus, a game developed at MIT to introduce the players to the command line.</p>
                    <p>In addition to jumping into the command line, by the end of the week you will have customized your RPI by installing software packages through <code>apt</code> and the GUI. You will also choose your topic for the first project and set up a Trello with a Board for your project and milestones for each week until it’s due.</p>

                    <p>As you’re working on finishing up your first RPI project, we’ll take a deeper look at how files, permissions and security works on RPI and in linux/unix operating systems generally. To better understand how to work with files, we’ll take a look at file archives (multiple files and directories combined in a single file) and compression (reducing the size of a file). Because your programs all run as a “user” (either root or their own user), it’s important to understand files and permissions to troubleshoot problems.</p>

                    <p>For a more in-depth look at networking, you will work with a partner to write a mini report on a related topic. Please: a) choose a partner, and b) choose a topic from the list below. If you have an idea for a different topic, you may write about that with approval from the instructors. By the end of the week, please post your report directly into our <em>Networking Topics</em> forum. Your report should be roughly 500-800 words. It should give an overview of the topic, summary of how it works, and discussion of how it’s used and why it is (or isn’t) important. Read through the other posts, and ask any follow-up questions. The instructor and topic authors will do their best to answer your questions.</p>

<h2>The Center for Academic Support and Enrichment (CASE; formerly The Learning and Writing Centers)</h2>
<p>
CASE programs and services--like individual tutoring in writing and subjects across the
curriculum, small group study sessions, academic coaching, and targeted workshops--help
students explore, deepen, and extend their classroom learning. Support programming focuses
on establishing foundational skills and techniques of studentship, like time management and
note-taking. Enrichment services develop higher-order critical thinking skills and problem solving
skills inherent in both abstractions and applications of curricular study.

<h2>The Adelphi Honor Code</h2>
<p>
  The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to
  this pursuit is academic integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s
  Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to uphold the principles of honesty and civility
  embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth and honesty and I will
  forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h3>Code of Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying,
cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation
  marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to
  produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized
  collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is
  plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-
  generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of
  plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as
  ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or
  otherwise) for student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are,
  please reach out to me to discuss it as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic
  integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review and could result in
  disciplinary action. <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty</a>.
</p>

<h2>Diversity statement</h2>
We value human dignity and diversity in all forms, embrace our differences, and honor all
voices. We understand the collective power inherent in fully inclusive communities where each
may meet their full potential to contribute.


<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that
the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and
students are strongly encouraged to respond. Please be assured that your responses are
anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after course grades have
been submitted after the semester ends.

<h2>Religious observance policy</h2>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious
observances. Students who anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are
required by Adelphi University to notify their professors at the start of the semester. This will
allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their course exam and
assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on
those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment
deadline missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out
suitable arrangements for make-ups or other satisfaction of academic requirements.
