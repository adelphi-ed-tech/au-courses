                    <h2>Spring 2017 Studio: Hackers</h2>
                    <p>Each semester the multimedia studio features a different challenge, dealing with an important, global topic. Students will be asked to work on a semester long multimedia project that teaches some aspect of this challenge.</p>
                    <p>The Spring 2017 Studio theme is information security, hackers, and digital privacy. We believe that cyber-security is an increasingly important digital literacy, and that a broad understanding of issues in this arena are necessary for robust public discourse and democratic processes. By the end of 2016, cyber-security and computer “hacking” had become topics that can no longer be easily ignored, with high profile issues such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>State sponsored Russian hacks aiming to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election</li>
                    <li>Major security breaches, such as Yahoo Mail’s disclosure that half a billion emails were compromised</li>
                    <li>Debates over widespread use of encryption and government “back doors” (such as the Apple/FBI showdown over unlocking the San Bernadino shooter’s iPhone)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each student will study an aspect of information security in depth, and then complete a multimedia educational project that aims to explain and enrich our understanding of the topic.</p>

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>This course is designed to challenge students to develop their abilities as instructional designers and as authors and producers of digital media for learning. Specifically, they should learn to:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>design an effective digital learning environment that is intuitive to use and follows principles of Universal Design for Learning</li>
                    <li>develop in-depth skill in one area of digital production: video editing, graphic design, game design, computer programming, web design, etc.</li>
                    <li>understand key concepts of instructional design, including meeting the needs of the target audience, assessing learning outcomes, and following sound and ethical pedagogical principles</li>
                    <li>think creatively about far-reaching challenges in teaching and learning</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>At the end of the studio, every student will have a high quality, published multimedia artifact that will be part of their portfolio.</p>

You will choose a specific topic of your choice related to information security and then write a short (300 word) report and create a bibliography of sources on the topic.

                    <li>Have a <strong>point</strong>: like a good essay, a good talk should deliver an original, targeted point of view that you will logically and rhetorically convey.</li>

The purpose of the pitch is to propose your project in a way that makes it sound exciting, worthwhile, and feasible. You want to tell a good story about what you plan to develop. You should also have some sketches, mockups, sample art, etc. that may be required to make your point.</p>

                    <ul>

                    <li>is the design accessible?
                    <ul>
                    <li>does it support the widest possible range of computer systems (including OS, web browser, screen size/mobile, processor speed, internet connection quality)</li>

Users should not easily “break” the system. The specifics of development depend on the media. So, each of the various skills required for the course will be evaluated based on the practice of expert practitioners.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>is video composed and edited like an expert video?</li>

<h2>The Center for Academic Support and Enrichment (CASE; formerly The Learning and Writing Centers)</h2>
<p>
CASE programs and services--like individual tutoring in writing and subjects across the
curriculum, small group study sessions, academic coaching, and targeted workshops--help
students explore, deepen, and extend their classroom learning. Support programming focuses
on establishing foundational skills and techniques of studentship, like time management and
note-taking. Enrichment services develop higher-order critical thinking skills and problem solving
skills inherent in both abstractions and applications of curricular study.

<h2>The Adelphi Honor Code</h2>
<p>
  The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to
  this pursuit is academic integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s
  Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to uphold the principles of honesty and civility
  embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth and honesty and I will
  forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h3>Code of Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying,
cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation
  marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to
  produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized
  collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is
  plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-
  generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of
  plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as
  ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or
  otherwise) for student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are,
  please reach out to me to discuss it as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic
  integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review and could result in
  disciplinary action. <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty</a>.
</p>

<h2>Diversity statement</h2>
We value human dignity and diversity in all forms, embrace our differences, and honor all
voices. We understand the collective power inherent in fully inclusive communities where each
may meet their full potential to contribute.


<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that
the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and
students are strongly encouraged to respond. Please be assured that your responses are
anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after course grades have
been submitted after the semester ends.

<h2>Religious observance policy</h2>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious
observances. Students who anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are
required by Adelphi University to notify their professors at the start of the semester. This will
allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their course exam and
assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on
those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment
deadline missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out
suitable arrangements for make-ups or other satisfaction of academic requirements.
