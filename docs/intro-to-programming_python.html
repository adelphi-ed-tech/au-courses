                    introduces students to programming and core concepts
                    of computer science, using a modern, object oriented
                    programming language (currently Python). Students
                    learn concepts of variables, functions,
                    repetition/loops, basic data structures (arrays,
                    lists, dictionaries), and basic object oriented
                    programming.</p>

                    <li><strong><a
                    href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Code
                    Studio aka VS Code</a></strong>. For this class we
                    will be programming in the <a
                    href="https://python.org">Python</a> programming
                    language, using an <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%20Integrated_development_environment">Integrated
                    Development Environment (IDE)</a> called CS Code.
                    This software will allow you to write your Python
                    code in a programmer’s text editor, run you code to
                    see the results, and to run instructor-provided test
                    code to verify your solutions. You will probably use
                    the online programming environment included with the
                    textbook for the simple textbook exercises, but you
                    will want to use VS Code for the more complex
                    programs and to make better screen recordings for
                    your portfolio. Follow the reference materials below
                    for instructions on how to install VS Code and
                    Python for your operating system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Screenshot software.</strong> To get
                    help, you might need to share a screenshot (more
                    often you will copy-paste code or error messages).
                    Don’t take pictures of your laptop with you phone.
                    Take a screenshot. If you need help setting this up
                    or getting recommendations, ask on
                    <code>#code</code> on slack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Screen recording and video
                    editing.</strong> Your grades in this class are
                    portfolio based; based narrated screencasts you make
                    of your code and problem solving, where you
                    demonstrate your mastery of key concepts in computer
                    science. Like screenshot software, there are many
                    solutions making screen recordings and editing
                    videos. <strong>Mac users</strong> will be able to
                    use the combination of <a
                    href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721">Quicktime
                    Player</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/">iMovie</a>.
                    <strong>Windows users</strong> don’t have quite the
                    same power built in, but Microsoft offers screen
                    recording with the <a
                    href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21222533/record-screen-pc-windows-laptop-xbox-game-bar-how-to">XBox

                    application. I recommend <a
                    href="https://obsproject.com/">Open Broadcaster
                    Studio (OBS)</a> for screen recordings (it works on
                    Mac too). I use <a

                    <p>This is a fully asynchronous online class, which
                    will run on a Wednesday-Wednesday schedule, meaning
                    new topics will begin each Wednesday. There are no
                    set meeting times, and there will not be Zoom or
                    other video class sessions. You will be able to
                    flexibly schedule your time within the week for each
                    topic. As a 3 credit graduate course, you should
                    plan to spend approximately eight hours each week
                    working on materials for this course. This includes
                    assigned readings, videos, programming exercises,
                    group/peer meetings, and tutoring sessions.</p>

                    and group tutoring</a>, which can be either in
                    person or online, scheduled through their website.
                    This is an excellent, free service and you might
                    want to schedule a session to go over some of the
                    labs. In addition, Math and Computer Science has
                    free, drop-in tutoring sessions on weekday
                    afternoons in the Garden City campus. They may also
                    post some Zoom sessions. I will post the schedule

                    group. You should set up a text or Slack channel for

                    you can reach out to when you get stuck or need

                    that you share and get feedback on your portfolios
                    with this team before you submit them for grading.

                    use work that you’ve done in the course (chapter
                    exercises and challenge problems) to demonstrate
                    your knowledge of key ideas. Your portfolio must
                    show code that you have written, which you use to
                    explain the key concepts for each portfolio. The
                    code samples that you choose must be from chapter

                    Scientist</em> or challenge problems posted on the

                    make a good video:</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                    <li><strong>Make good use of the time.</strong>
                    Write an outline for your video before recording.
                    Open all of the documents (code, browser tabs) you
                    need. Practice what you are going to say.</li>
                    <li><strong>Record in high definition (aka HD, or
                    1920x1080 or higher)</strong>. Since reading text on
                    the screen is key to the portfolio, make sure that
                    you are making a high resolution video so that the
                    text isn’t pixelated/blurry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Record clear audio</strong>. Test out
                    your mic before you record the whole thing and make
                    sure that your audio is coming through clearly. The
                    code on screen pluse your narration <em>are</em> the
                    portfolio.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lightly edit.</strong> It will be hard
                    to make the video all in one take. Consider using
                    video editing software to join clips together, add
                    still screenshots, and edit out dead time.
                    <em>Don’t</em> feel obligated to do anything fancy
                    (background music, fast/slow motion, titles,
                    credits, transitions).</li>
                    <li><strong>Include code you wrote.</strong> Just to
                    be clear, your video should include code that you
                    have written. It is up to you if you want to show
                    several different exercises, a larger program from a
                    challenge problem, or something else that you have
                    written. <strong>Do not show somebody else’s
                    code.</strong> If you include code that you didn’t
                    write (from the book, written by an AI, found
                    online, written by a friend) please indicate that in
                    the comments and in your narration. Passing off
                    someone else’s work as your own is clear academic
                    dishonesty and will lead to a zero for this
                    assignment and possibly further disciplinary
                    action.</li>

<h2>The Adelphi Honor Code</h2>
<p>
  The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to
  this pursuit is academic integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s
  Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to uphold the principles of honesty and civility
  embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth and honesty and I will
  forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h3>Code of Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying,
cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation
  marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to
  produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized
  collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is
  plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-
  generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of
  plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as
  ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or
  otherwise) for student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are,
  please reach out to me to discuss it as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic
  integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review and could result in
  disciplinary action. <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty</a>.
</p>

<h2>Diversity statement</h2>
We value human dignity and diversity in all forms, embrace our differences, and honor all
voices. We understand the collective power inherent in fully inclusive communities where each
may meet their full potential to contribute.


<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that
the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and
students are strongly encouraged to respond. Please be assured that your responses are
anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after course grades have
been submitted after the semester ends.

<h2>Religious observance policy</h2>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious
observances. Students who anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are
required by Adelphi University to notify their professors at the start of the semester. This will
allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their course exam and
assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on
those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment
deadline missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out
suitable arrangements for make-ups or other satisfaction of academic requirements.
