<h1 id="generative-ai--chatgpt-policy">Generative AI / ChatGPT Policy</h1>
<p>Since the introduction of GPT-3, programmers have been using
generative AI as an integral part of their work. Some are
predicting <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/the-end-of-programming/">the end of programming</a>,
but I think it’s just another iteration in the tools that computer scientists and software
engineers have at their disposal to create software more quickly and efficiently.
In particular, it can help us learn new things and reduce the risk of trying
something new.</p>

<p>The general rule for this course is that <strong>generative AI can be used for learning</strong>,
but it is a violation of Adelphi’s academic honesty policy and
<strong>considered cheating</strong> if you submit work that was generated by AI as your own.
<strong>You must disable Gemini in your Google Colab environment.</strong>
[Settings–&gt;AI Assistance–&gt; Hide generative AI features ]</p>

<p>Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lab exercises cannot be written by AI 
(i.e. if you upload the question to ChatGPT and then post its answer, you will risk receiving 0 points)</li>
  <li>you may always ask it about the API, to produce examples (e.g., _show me how to make a bar graph in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Matplotlib_</code>)</li>
  <li>you may submit your code to AI for suggestions, feedback, and debugging</li>
  <li>you can use AI as a companion in your project code, either to write “routine” code, 
or help do something new (e.g., <em>how can I make a map with a legend in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GeoPandas</code>?</em>)</li>
  <li>if you incorporate significant AI code in your project, you must document it in comments
and be prepared to explain it in your final presentation</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: it is not that hard for me to spot code you didn’t 
write (whether from a friend, AI, a “cheating” website, etc).</p>

<h3 id="participation-15">Participation (15%)</h3>

<p>You will complete three self-evaluations of your participation in the course
by completing a Google Form. Your self-eval will be averaged with the instructor’s
evaluation at the end of the semester.</p>

<p>Because this is a self-evaluation, you will have to set your own criteria for
how you evaluate your participation. Here are some things that I will be looking
for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do you set aside time to work on the course each week?</li>
  <li>do you complete labs on time?</li>
  <li>do you ask for help when you are stuck?</li>
  <li>do you help others on slack or over email?</li>
  <li>do you share your work, relevant ideas, and resources?</li>
  <li>do you find time to study or work with other students?</li>
  <li>do you complete assignments on time?</li>
  <li><strong>do not</strong> abandon your teammates</li>
  <li>do not turn in work written by AI or other students</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="labs-30">Labs (30%)</h3>

<p>There will be 10 programming “labs” during the course of the semester.
Each lab will provide a few challenges based on the goals and examples
of the week. You will</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>0 points</em>: for not turning in any work</li>
  <li><em>1-2 points</em>: for a basic attempt, but code isn’t working or has fundamental flaws</li>
  <li><em>3 points</em>: solution works and demonstrates mastery of relevant concepts</li>
</ul>

<p>Some labs may have bonus problems. You should always try to do the
bonus problems. They are focused more on problems solving and
core “CS” concepts than the project-based exercises. If you submit
a nice bonus solution, you may earn an extra point towards your lab
score (but the total can’t exceed 30 points).</p>

<p>Labs are due by midnight on Tuesday of the week they are assigned. To turn
in your lab:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Save a copy of the weekly lab to your Colab.</li>
  <li>Rename it with your last name and the lab number, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curinga-lab1.ipynb</code></li>
  <li>Share the document with the instructor <a href="mailto:mcuringa@adelphi.edu">mcuringa@adelphi.edu</a></li>
</ol>

</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
<h3 id="midterm-census-data-analysis-25">Midterm: census data analysis (25%)</h3>

<p>The midterm will be a pair project that you complete <strong>with your assigned partner</strong>
(see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlRZEpIeROtgi_jB3PX2tyfch1QHsqLYVY_48jEz3H4/edit?usp=sharing">the roster</a>).</p>

<p>For this project you will choose an area of interest in the United States
Census ACS data set. You will create a Jupyter Notebook in Colab
that loads this data, cleans it, explores and describes the data,
and demonstrates how it can be used.</p>

<p>Your Notebook must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the code to load and clean the data</li>
  <li>better column names for the data, following our class conventions</li>
  <li>a mardkown <strong>data dictionary</strong> describing each field</li>
  <li>markdown analysis of interesting patterns and findings supported
by the data and code</li>
  <li>merging the census data with spatial data</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, your Colab Notebook must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all of the code used to create your analysis</li>
  <li>an introduction, headers, written discussion as markdown blocks</li>
  <li>at least one interactive map with shapes, points, a color map, tool tips, and popups</li>
  <li>at least two tables of data
    <ul>
      <li>tables must be well formatted/styled</li>
      <li>at least one table must use grouped data and aggregate functions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>markdown text blocks that provide a narrative analysis of the data
and relevant descriptions of the methods</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="linkable">Project evaluation criteria</h4>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Content/question:</strong> is the data set chosen interesting and relevant? 
does the code and written analysis present engaging, preliminary findings?</li>
  <li><strong>Programming:</strong> is the code well written and efficient?
Does it demonstrate mastery of the concepts covered in the course to this point?
Specifically, you should use variable to make your program more flexible and
easier to read. Variables should be well named. You shouldn’t have any unused 
code, commented out code, or redundant statements.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk:</strong> does the project take a risk? Does it try to do something new or
different? Low-risk projects very closely resemble the examples and labs;
high-risk projects try to do something new or different, even if it doesn’t
work exactly right.</li>
  <li><strong>Visualization &amp; presentation:</strong> is the map easy to read and easy to use? Can
the user use the map to explore the data? Is the text edited (no typos, clear prose)?
Is text formatted in HTML and markdown as needed? Are data tables well formatted
and have appropriate column headers and output? Are the charts and graphs selected 
a good match for the data presented? Does the project make good use of color and 
size to convey quantitative information?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Both team members will receive the same grade for the project. This means
that both members should be prepared to explain any aspect of the project
during the instructor meeting and to demonstrate their ability to write
new code.</em></p>

<h3 id="final-project-30">Final project (30%)</h3>
<p>The final project will follow the same format as the midterm project,
except everyone will work alone and turn in their own work.The final
project offers you a chance to make more complex maps and visualizations
and it is your opportunity to demonstrate everything you have learned
this semester. There are no strict requirements for the elements
of your work, but it should include a mix of written analysis in markdown,
formatted tables, interactive charts, and interactive maps. To add
complexity to the work you began in the midterm project, you will
probably want to use Census variables from more than one table, look
at multiple years, compare regions, etc.</p>

<p><em>The final project will be evaluated on the <a href="#project_evaluation_criteria">same criteria as the midterm</a>.</em></p>

<h1 id="class-sessions">Class Sessions</h1>
<p>We’re going to operate this async course on a Wednesday to Wednesday schedule.
That means that each Wednesday, will start a new module, and the lab
for that week will be due by end of day on the following Tuesday.
Modules will generally start with an audio introduction to the materials
and a link to a Google Colab notebook. The notebook will contain
all links to all other readings and videos, as well as sample code
and lab exercises.</p>

integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to
uphold the principles of honesty and civility embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth
and honesty and I will forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.”</p>

<h3 id="code-of-academic-integrity">Code of Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/policies/academic-integrity/">Code of Academic Integrity </a> 
prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying, cheating, or stealing.
<a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">Academic dishonesty</a> or 
violations of the Code of Academic Integrity include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>

<p>Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation marks, citations and references,
constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately.
Unauthorized collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is plagiarism. Content
generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without
attribution or authorization is also a form of plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based
technologies, such as ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or otherwise) for
student assignments or exams.</p>

is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and students are strongly encouraged to respond.
Please be assured that your responses are anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after
course grades have been submitted after the semester ends.</p>

<h3 id="religious-observance-policy">Religious Observance Policy</h3>
<p>Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community and respects various religious observances. Students who
anticipate being absent due to their religious observance are required by Adelphi University to notify their professors
at the start of the semester. This will allow faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their
course exam and assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on those
days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment deadline missed because of
those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out suitable arrangements for make-ups or other
satisfaction of academic requirements. 
<a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/policies/absence-policy/">Adelphi’s Exam/Assignment Absence Policy can be viewed here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>Only students who are registered for courses, and whose name appears on the Official Class Roster may attend courses at
the University. Adelphi students make a commitment to be active participants in their educational program; class
attendance is an integral part of this commitment. Students are expected to be present promptly at the beginning of each
class period, unless prevented by illness or by other compelling cause. In the event of such absence, students may
request that faculty members be notified by the Office of Academic Services and Retention. Students are responsible for
learning course content and completing coursework missed through absences.</p>
