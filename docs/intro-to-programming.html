<h1 id="generative-ai--chatgpt-policy">Generative AI / ChatGPT Policy</h1>
<p>Since the introduction of GPT-3, programmers have been using
generative AI as an integral part of their work. Some are
predicting <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/the-end-of-programming/">the end of programming</a>,
but I think it’s just another iteration in the tools that computer scientists and software
engineers have at their disposal to create software more quickly and efficiently.
In particular, it can help us learn new things and reduce the risk of trying
something new.</p>

<p>The general rule for this course is that <strong>generative AI can be used for learning</strong>,
but it is a violation of Adelphi’s academic honesty policy and
<strong>considered cheating</strong> if you submit work that was generated by AI as your own.</p>

<p>Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lab exercises cannot be written by AI 
(i.e. if you upload the question to ChatGPT and then post its answer, you will risk receiving 0 points)</li>
  <li>you may always ask it about the API, to produce examples (e.g., _show me how to make a bar graph in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Matplotlib_</code>)</li>
  <li>you may submit your code to AI for suggestions, feedback, and debugging</li>
  <li>you can use AI as a companion in your project code, either to write “routine” code, 
or help do something new (e.g., <em>how can I make a map with a legend in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GeoPandas</code>?</em>)</li>
  <li>if you incorporate significant AI code in your project, you must document it in comments
and be prepared to explain it in your final presentation</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: it is not that hard for me to spot code you didn’t 
write (whether from a friend, AI, a “cheating” website, etc).</p>

<h3 id="participation-15">Participation (15%)</h3>

<p>You will complete three self-evaluations of your participation in the course
by completing a Google Form. Your self-eval will be averaged with the instructor’s
evaluation at the end of the semester.</p>

<p>Because this is a self-evaluation, you will have to set your own criteria for
how you evaluate your participation. Here are some things that I will be looking
for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do you set aside time to work on the course each week?</li>
  <li>do you complete labs on time?</li>
  <li>do you ask for help when you are stuck?</li>
  <li>do you help others on slack or over email?</li>
  <li>do you share your work, relevant ideas, and resources?</li>
  <li>do you find time to study or work with other students?</li>
  <li><strong>do not</strong> abandon your teammates</li>
  <li>do not turn in work written by AI or other students</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="labs-50">Labs (50%)</h3>

<p>There will be 10 programming “labs” during the course of the semester.
Each lab will provide a few challenges based on the goals and examples
of the week. You will</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>0 points</em>: for not turning in any work</li>
  <li><em>1-2 points</em>: for a basic attempt, but code isn’t working or has fundamental flaws</li>
  <li><em>3 points</em>: solution works and demonstrates mastery of relevant concepts</li>
</ul>

<p>Some labs may have bonus problems. You should always try to do the
bonus problems. They are focused more on problems solving and
core “CS” concepts than the project-based exercises. If you submit
a nice bonus solution, you may earn an extra point towards your lab
score (but the total can’t exceed 30 points).</p>

<p>Labs are due by midnight on Tuesday of the week they are assigned. To turn
in your lab:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Save a copy of the weekly lab to your Colab.</li>
  <li>Rename it with your last name and the lab number, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curinga-lab1.ipynb</code></li>
  <li>Share the document with the instructor <a href="mailto:mcuringa@adelphi.edu">mcuringa@adelphi.edu</a></li>
</ol>

</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
<h3 id="midterm-census-data-analysis-25">Midterm: census data analysis (25%)</h3>

<p>The midterm will be a pair project that you complete <strong>with your assigned partner</strong>
(see <a href="#roster">the roster</a>).</p>

<p>For this project you will create your own analysis of the US Census
data that we have been working with. You will investigate a question
that you think can be explored with the data available to us, and
you will use the methods of statistical and spatial analysis to
create a report that includes python code, written analysis,
interactive maps, data tables, and graphs.</p>

<p>Specifically, your Colab Notebook must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all of the code used to create your analysis</li>
  <li>an introduction, headers, written discussion as markdown blocks</li>
  <li>at least one interactive map with points and pop-ups</li>
  <li>at least one table of data</li>
  <li>at least one graph or chart</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-project-25">Final project (25%)</h3>

<p>For the final project you will work in a team of 2-3 people to create your own
data analysis and visualization using a data set that is available for
download or as a live open data set such as the <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">NYC Open Data</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, you may incorporate other data sets as you see fit.</p>

<p><strong>The final solution will be scored using the following guide:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Solution (7 points)</strong></p>

<p>How well does the program written solve the problem? Does the project seriously
engage with the data? Does it use compute analysis to provide interesting
insights? Is the data presented in a meaningful and usable way?</p>

<p>Your team’s ability to design a solution to the problem is evaluated by this measure.</p>

<p><strong>Elegance &amp; Robustness (8 points)</strong></p>

<p>This area evaluates the quality of the computer code produced by the team. An
<em>elegant</em> program provides a parsimonious solution that is both efficient and
clear. A <em>robust</em> program is flexible and able to change. In the case of data
analysis, it would be easy to modify if the input data changed or the output
requirements are updated. It wouldn’t “break” if it encountered unexpected data,
and would continue to operate even if the amount of data were increased
dramatically. Often, both elegance and robustness are achieved through
<em>refactoring</em>: the process of reflecting on code and revising it after an initial
working solution is achieved.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Taking (5 points)</strong></p>

<p>Learning should be an adventure. One of the most exciting things about writing
software is the sense of new possibilities and discovery. The “risk taking”
aspect of your team’s grade will reflect the chances that you take with your
project. Even if your solution isn’t quite what you hoped for, or your code
isn’t as elegant as you’d like, it’s important that you take chances and try new
things. To do well in this section, you might want to shoot for an ambitious, or
complex analysis; or integrate some Javascript libraries or techniques that haven’t been
explicitly covered in the course.</p>

<p><strong>Code Style (5 points)</strong></p>

<p>Your code should be well formatted and easy to read. Your functions and
variables (aka “identifiers”) should have clear, meaningful names. Comments
should be used sparingly, but appropriately to guide the human reader through
your code.</p>

<p><em>All project members will receive the same grade.</em></p>

<h1 id="class-sessions">Class Sessions</h1>
<p>We’re going to operate this async course on a Wednesday to Wednesday schedule.
That means that each Wednesday, will start a new module, and the lab
for that week will be due by end of day on the following Tuesday.
Modules will generally start with an audio introduction to the materials
and a link to a Google Colab notebook. The notebook will contain
all links to all other readings and videos, as well as sample code
and lab exercises.</p>

<h2 id="module-11-12-13-stats-data-cleaning-spatial-queries">Module 11, 12, 13: Stats, data cleaning, spatial queries?</h2>
<p>These three weeks are left intentionally blank. It’s
tough to have a student-directed learning experience
if everything is planned before we have met. There
are many topics to cover, so we will choose which ones
to focus on based on interest and the types of projects
students are pursuing.</p>

<p>We may want to take a deeper dive into statistical analysis.
We might want to add multiple layers and controls to the
maps. Maybe we want to collect data from more sources, including
live data streams, “scraped” data that isn’t ready immediately
ready for analysis (and must be cleaned), or text data that
requires some natural language processing. We might also
want to focus on making highly polished visuals, making
interactive graphs or integrating more advanced HTML/CSS
into our work. Almost certainly we will do further spatial
analysis, learning how to find where shapes overlap and border,
which points are contained within which shapes, etc.</p>

<p>In short, there are many possibilities and studying
any of them will help us gain a deeper understanding
of computer science, software engineering, and computer
programming.</p>

<h5>The Adelphi Honor Code</h5>
<p>
The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to this pursuit is academic
integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to
uphold the principles of honesty and civility embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth
and honesty and I will forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h5>Code of Academic Honesty</h5>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying, cheating, or stealing.
Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited to, the following:
<ol>
    <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
    <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
    <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
    <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
    <li>Plagiarism</li>
    <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
    <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
    <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
    <li>Cheating</li>
    <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation marks, citations and references,
constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately.
Unauthorized collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is plagiarism. Content
generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without
attribution or authorization is also a form of plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based
technologies, such as ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or otherwise) for
student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are, please reach out to me to discuss it
as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review
and could result in disciplinary action.

</p>

<h5>Student course evaluations</h5>
<p>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that the course evaluation
is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and students are strongly encouraged to respond.
Please be assured that your responses are anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after
course grades have been submitted after the semester ends.
</p>
<h5>Religious observance policy</h5>
<p>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious observances. Students who
anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are required by Adelphi University to notify their
professors at the start of the semester. This will allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in
light of their course exam and assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs,
etc. on those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment deadline
missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out suitable arrangements for make-ups or
other satisfaction of academic requirements.
