                    <p>This week’s reading response forum will take the
                    role of an “audio essay” where you upload an audio
                    response to this week’s readings. Like all of our
                    reading responses, you should have a clear point,
                    make interesting claims, and defend/explore them
                    with evidence. To practice our technical audio
                    production skills, you <em>must</em> include at
                    least 3 different audio clips from “Nice White
                    Parents”, and at least 2 other audio clips other
                    than your voice. Your post must be between 7 and 10
                    minutes. If it’s shorter, try to add some more
                    depth. If it’s too long, cut it until it’s more
                    focused. You should be able to upload your .mp3 or
                    .wav file directly to this forum, you can you post a
                    shared link to your google drive.</p>

<h2>Student Counseling Center (SCC)</h2>
<p>
The Student Counseling Center (SCC) provides confidential and professional virtual mental
health counseling services, resources, and referrals to support the academic and personal
success, health, and well-being of Adelphi students without additional charge. Especially with
the additional stress resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, students are encouraged to seek
support from the SCC when needed. Counselors are available to help students cope with a
variety of stressors and personal issues that may interfere with their academic and personal
experiences. The Center also supports students who may be feeling suicidal or in crisis. To
schedule an appointment, please call <a href="tel:+15168773646">(516) 877-3646</a>, email

<h2>The Center for Academic Support and Enrichment (CASE; formerly The Learning and Writing Centers)</h2>
<p>
CASE programs and services--like individual tutoring in writing and subjects across the
curriculum, small group study sessions, academic coaching, and targeted workshops--help
students explore, deepen, and extend their classroom learning. Support programming focuses
on establishing foundational skills and techniques of studentship, like time management and
note-taking. Enrichment services develop higher-order critical thinking skills and problem solving
skills inherent in both abstractions and applications of curricular study. 
</p>
<p>
Contact us as <a href="mailto:CASE@adelphi.edu">CASE@adelphi.edu</a> 
(or <a href="mailto:Learningcenter@adelphi.edu">Learningcenter@adelphi.edu</a>), at ext. 3200, or via
our <a href="https://ecampus.adelphi.edu/learningcenter/sso.php">eCampus tab</a>, to review our full slate of real-time (in person and remote) and asynchronous
services. These are included in your tuition so you've already bought them! Don't miss out on
the opportunity to supercharge your college experience! Many services require reservations,
especially late in the semester. Reserve a spot on our <a href="https://ecampus.adelphi.edu/learningcenter/sso.php?_gl=1*1mecxli*_ga*MTY5OTk0NjI0NC4xNDU2OTM1NDM4*_ga_3JL8015KTW*MTY5MTA4NzQ0Mi40NDYuMS4xNjkxMDkwNTk2LjAuMC4w*_ga_RWKYLG5ZDT*MTY5MTA4NzQ0Mi4xNDMwLjEuMTY5MTA5MDU5Ni42MC4wLjA.">scheduling portal</a>,

<h2>The Adelphi Honor Code</h2>
<p>
  The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to
  this pursuit is academic integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s
  Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to uphold the principles of honesty and civility
  embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth and honesty and I will
  forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h3>Code of Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying,
cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation
  marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to
  produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized
  collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is
  plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-
  generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of
  plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as
  ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or
  otherwise) for student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are,
  please reach out to me to discuss it as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic
  integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review and could result in
  disciplinary action. <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty</a>.
</p>

<h2>Diversity statement</h2>
We value human dignity and diversity in all forms, embrace our differences, and honor all
voices. We understand the collective power inherent in fully inclusive communities where each
may meet their full potential to contribute.


<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that
the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and
students are strongly encouraged to respond. Please be assured that your responses are
anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after course grades have
been submitted after the semester ends.

<h2>Religious observance policy</h2>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious
observances. Students who anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are
required by Adelphi University to notify their professors at the start of the semester. This will
allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their course exam and
assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on
those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment
deadline missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out
suitable arrangements for make-ups or other satisfaction of academic requirements.
