                    major part of both higher education and K-12
                    teaching, learning. Students need to become aware of
                    this new method of teaching, learning and
                    instructional delivery. Students who wish to become
                    educational professionals need to understand the
                    pedagogy, best practices, interactivity and
                    student-centered instructional design principles
                    required for quality online, blended and
                    web-enhanced learning. Students should also have an
                    understanding of the political issues surrounding
                    online, blended and web-enhanced learning such as
                    cost, technical infrastructure, teacher development,
                    student and teacher support and profit.</p>

                    <h3>Remote Learning Report (pair)</h3>
                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic uprooted schools across the
                    globe, at every level of learning. Public school
                    systems struggled to move to online formats.
                    University enrollments plummeted. “Essential”
                    standardized assessments were postponed or canceled.
                    Many open questions remain about the effectiveness
                    of the various approaches to learning during the
                    pandemic. In fact, we don’t have a clear picture,
                    yet, of the whole spectrum of modifications that
                    took place. For this project, you will investigate a
                    particular aspect of remote learning during the
                    pandemic and write a paper (1,500 - 1,800 words)
                    with your findings. Examples of possible topics:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>“Meeting the needs of special education students
                    through remote learning”</li>
                    <li>“Who left higher ed due to COVID-19 and what did
                    they do instead?”</li>
                    <li>“A report on university efforts to maintain
                    ‘community’ during lockdown and remote
                    learning”</li>
                    <li>“Models of remote instruction in K-12 schools:
                    synchronous, asynchronous, learning pods, hybrid,
                    and more”</li>
                    <li>“Global models of remote education: report from
                    North America, Europe, and Asia”</li>
                    <li>“Lab sciences and the lockdown”</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You paper will gather research that allows you to
                    learn about and fully describe your topic. Start
                    with newspaper articles and magazine articles
                    (available for search through the <a
                    href="https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.adelphi.edu/bisacademicresearchhome?crid=d0cc6122-24e3-49d5-8c7a-fa9cc4e362c4&amp;pdmfid=1516831&amp;pdisurlapi=true">Lexis
                    Nexis database</a>). You can also incorporate
                    primary sources such as school district
                    announcements, state agency reports, social media
                    posts from educators/students/parents, etc. Your
                    paper should be organized into the following
                    sections:</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                    <li>Introduction: describe the topic, why it’s
                    important, what type of data you gathered</li>
                    <li>Analysis: review the news articles, reports, and
                    other data that your investigation uncovered.
                    Organize and synthesize the findings to offer a
                    coherent look at the topic. Consider how “remote
                    learning” in practice compares to our understanding
                    of the best practices for online instruction.</li>
                    <li>Conclusion: extend your analysis to point to
                    which approaches to remote learning were most
                    effective, which should be avoided, and which areas
                    need further research and refinement.</li>

                    <p>This paper should be a <strong>pair

                    the core results of your paper. These videos will be

                    <section id="mini-unit" class="level3">
                    <h3>Mini-unit</h3>
                    <p>The online mini-unit constitutes the biggest part
                    of your grade and is split into two phases:
                    Prototype and Final Run. Together these will take up
                    roughly the last four weeks of the semester. During
                    the Prototype phase, you will run a rough and/or
                    partial version of your mini-unit, and the rest of
                    the class will enroll as students. We will give you
                    feedback that you will use to revise for the Final
                    Run, which will have to be polished. You will get
                    feedback again that you can use to revise it one
                    more time.</p>
                    <p>The mini-unit is a culmination of all the
                    readings and assignments you did in this class. It
                    should be a self-contained, complete unit that would
                    take up roughly 3 hours of a student’s time. This
                    means you shouldn’t have students watch a 3-hour
                    long video or read a novel, as it would take up too
                    much time; nor should it be too short. If your unit
                    is intended for a younger audience, let us know and
                    we can adjust our expectations. The mini-unit can be
                    about something you might teach in class or it could
                    be something fun that works well as an online unit.
                    The unit should contain assessment(s) that checks
                    for understanding. It should also contain some
                    logical progression, so it shouldn’t be just a
                    single lesson or tutorial. Finally, it should be
                    designed for a minimum of 15 students. You won’t
                    have that many enrolled in this class but it should
                    be designed to accommodate at least 15 students.</p>
                    <p><a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TlxSJKDV-6JW-5Fc098lPmqVaQn2LIs9bz-kq4xZvvQ">Prototype</a></p>
                    <p>In Week 11 and 12 we will prototype the courses.
                    Half the class will be teachers for the week and the
                    other half will be students in three courses. This
                    way each course will have 3-5 students enrolled. The
                    prototype should focus on the part of the lesson
                    that is most experimental or has the most most open
                    questions. You may need to test if your assessment
                    is valid or if your activity instructions are clear,
                    or whether a video or written instructional material
                    is more effective. The prototype should be developed
                    enough for us to evaluate whether it is headed in
                    the right direction and whether it adequately
                    reflects your understanding of the topics covered in
                    the class. At the very least it should have
                    activities to do and it should be built on a
                    platform of your choice. As the unit designer, you
                    will be in charge of running the unit as the
                    instructor. If you are not presenting that week,
                    then you should enroll in three of your peers’ units
                    that week; this should give everyone plenty of
                    feedback.</p>
                    <p><strong>Don’t use Edmodo</strong>: Although some
                    of you may be familiar with Edmodo, the way it is
                    designed makes it difficult to differentiate between
                    different classes. Here’s one done on <a
                    href="http://gw730.weebly.com">Weebly</a> that is

                    the past.</p>
                    <p>Your Prototype will be evaluated based on whether
                    the part you presented was functional and ready;
                    whether you had sufficient interaction with your
                    students; and whether it demonstrated an
                    understanding of design principles we discussed,
                    especially Multimedia Theory and Universal Design.
                    If you are a student, your participation will be
                    evaluated by the unit designer; this grade will go
                    towards your participation grade that week.
                    Participating as a student means getting involved in
                    the activities, not just looking at the website.</p>
                    <p><a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EFCDxZjtj4s6aolxtieLJJm1dKHF7Un7G8M_-G6PhF8">Final
                    Run</a></p>
                    <p>After your Prototype has run, go through the
                    comments you received and list 3-5 of the main,
                    recurring themes that you want to address. As the
                    unit designer, you can choose to accept or reject
                    any comments, provided you give a rationale. This
                    should be turned in as part of your Final Run.
                    (Write a summary of the comments and actions you
                    took, about 500 words).</p>
                    <p>The Final Run will occur two weeks after you
                    present your Prototype. That means if you presented
                    your Prototype first, you will do the Final Run
                    first as well. The upside of that is you will have a
                    lot more time to polish it before you turn it in. It
                    should be a fully functional mini-unit.
                    Everything—the activities, the discussions, the
                    assessments—should work. Your evaluation will be
                    based on whether the mini-unit as a whole was
                    cohesive, had a logical progression in topics, had
                    meaningful assessments that let students know how
                    they are doing, was thoughtfully designed and
                    straightforward to navigate.</p>
                    <p>After your unit has run, collect the feedback
                    again and do any additional revisions you want. You
                    will turn in the mini-unit at the end of the
                    semester. As with the Final Run, it should come with
                    a short (1-2 pages double-spaced) description of
                    what feedback you used or rejected. It should also
                    point me to any changes you made since the Final
                    Run.</p>
                    <p><strong>Design Tips</strong></p>
                    <p>Here are some tips based on previous classes:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Think about the design: Simplify the way
                    students interact with the course (e.g., uploading,
                    taking screenshots, clicking around, etc.).
                    Sometimes there are things within the platform
                    itself that can make navigation easier. Don’t put
                    the burden of organizing the learning on the
                    students. Instead, do all you reasonably can to
                    design the learning experience. For example, in this
                    class, if you’re given a hyperlink to an eBook, the
                    link will take you to the right page. Little things
                    like this significantly improves the navigation.
                    This often means more upfront design work on your
                    part, but it’s worth avoiding confusion or
                    frustration.</li>
                    <li>Consider the online context: Your activities
                    shouldn’t try to replicate the experience of a
                    face-to-face (f2f) class. Think about how the online
                    class transforms the activity. In some cases, your
                    activity will have to be re-configured to fit the
                    online environment; in other cases, you may have to
                    find a different kind of activity.</li>
                    <li>Don’t bind yourself to a daily schedule: Online
                    classes don’t need to have a Monday-through-Friday
                    schedule; they can be self-paced or they can have
                    interactions that are more spaced out.</li>
                    <li>Empathize the student’s journey: Imagine (at
                    least) two kinds of students, one who will go to one
                    end of the unit and go through it linearly and
                    another who might skip around and see what’s out
                    there. How will these two students experience it
                    differently? If your unit is meant to be
                    uni-directional, then design it that way and make
                    the instructions clear.</li>
                    <li>Provide multiple paths: Put your instructions in
                    more than one place so that students won’t miss
                    them. Make sure they are consistent.</li>
                    <li>Make it sustainable: A common flaw in past
                    mini-units is that they were designed for only the
                    number of students they expected to enroll for this
                    class. There would often be activities or
                    interactions that clearly won’t accommodate a larger
                    number. That’s why you’re asked to design it to
                    accommodate at least 15 students.</li>

                    <h3>Participation</h3>
                    <p>This is a graduate course where you are expected
                    to complete weekly readings and fully participate in
                    discussions in class and on Moodle. In order for the
                    discussion to flow smoothly online, you should
                    respond to the voicethread and forum discussion by
                    the dates noted on the syllabus, and spend the
                    remainder of the week responding to what your peers
                    have posted. Your responses to your peers should be
                    thoughtful, critical and substantive. Your
                    participation grade will be based on the timeliness
                    and quality of your posts, your responses to your
                    peers, and any other activities that might be
                    associated with the week. Your participation grade
                    is given out on a weekly basis. You can track your
                    participation grade on Moodle. For each week of the
                    course you will earn either 0 or 1 points for

<h2>The Center for Academic Support and Enrichment (CASE; formerly The Learning and Writing Centers)</h2>
<p>
CASE programs and services--like individual tutoring in writing and subjects across the
curriculum, small group study sessions, academic coaching, and targeted workshops--help
students explore, deepen, and extend their classroom learning. Support programming focuses
on establishing foundational skills and techniques of studentship, like time management and
note-taking. Enrichment services develop higher-order critical thinking skills and problem solving
skills inherent in both abstractions and applications of curricular study. 
</p>
<p>
Contact us as <a href="mailto:CASE@adelphi.edu">CASE@adelphi.edu</a>

<h2>The Adelphi Honor Code</h2>
<p>
  The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to
  this pursuit is academic integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s
  Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to uphold the principles of honesty and civility
  embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth and honesty and I will
  forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h3>Code of Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying,
cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation
  marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to
  produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized
  collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is
  plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-
  generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of
  plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as
  ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or
  otherwise) for student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are,
  please reach out to me to discuss it as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic
  integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review and could result in
  disciplinary action. <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty</a>.
</p>

<h2>Diversity statement</h2>
We value human dignity and diversity in all forms, embrace our differences, and honor all
voices. We understand the collective power inherent in fully inclusive communities where each
may meet their full potential to contribute.


<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that
the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and
students are strongly encouraged to respond. Please be assured that your responses are
anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after course grades have
been submitted after the semester ends.

<h2>Religious observance policy</h2>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious
observances. Students who anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are
required by Adelphi University to notify their professors at the start of the semester. This will
allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their course exam and
assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on
those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment
deadline missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out
suitable arrangements for make-ups or other satisfaction of academic requirements.
