<h2 id="goals--objectives">Goals &amp; objectives</h2>
<p>Online, blended and web-enhanced learning is a major part of both higher
education and K-12 teaching, learning. Students need to become aware of this new
method of teaching, learning and instructional delivery. Students who wish to
become educational professionals need to understand the pedagogy, best
practices, interactivity and student-centered instructional design principles
required for quality online, blended and web-enhanced learning. Students should
also have an understanding of the political issues surrounding online, blended
and web-enhanced learning such as cost, technical infrastructure, teacher
development, student and teacher support and profit.</p>

<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of the course, students should be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the basic tenets, movement and use of online, blended and web-enhanced
learning in K-12 and higher education;</li>
  <li>understand various technologies used for teaching and learning and course delivery
in online, blended and web-enhanced environments;</li>
  <li>apply principles for the development of engaging and interactive online, blended
and web-enhanced curriculum;</li>
  <li>design learning environments that address the challenges of creating interaction
and community in online and virtual environments;</li>

<h3 id="narrated-tutorial">Narrated Tutorial</h3>

<p>Create a short (3-5 minute) standalone, narrated video tutorial or mini-lecture
and upload it to YouTube. This video should be clearly narrated and thoughtfully
designed, following the principles of Multimedia Theory and using an appropriate
mix of multimedia (text, visual, audio, etc.) components. The topic is up to
you, but it should be educational and/or informative. You may pick a topic that
you might use for your mini-unit (see below) or in a future lesson, or you can
choose a topic that you are expert in and enthusiastic to share with us. The
video can easily be created using applications such as PowerPoint or Keynote, or
a screencast application like <a href="https://obsproject.com/">Open Broadcast Studio</a>
(the software I use for screencasts),
<a href="https://www.screencastify.com/">Screencastify</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?embed=no&amp;v=DEkEZnJe_Pc">Quicktime
Player</a>, <a href="https://explaineverything.com">Explain
Everything</a> or similar application. While you can use
clips from other videos, don’t insert clips longer than 15-20 seconds.</p>

<h3 id="remote-learning-report-pair">Remote Learning Report (pair)</h3>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic uprooted schools across the globe, at every level of
learning. Public school systems struggled to move to online formats. University
enrollments plummeted. “Essential” standardized assessments were postponed or
canceled. Many open questions remain about the effectiveness of the various
approaches to learning during the pandemic. In fact, we don’t have a clear
picture, yet, of the whole spectrum of modifications that took place. For this
project, you will investigate a particular aspect of remote learning during the
pandemic and write a paper (1,500 - 1,800 words) with your findings. Examples of
possible topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Meeting the needs of special education students through remote learning”</li>
  <li>“Who left higher ed due to COVID-19 and what did they do instead?”</li>
  <li>“A report on university efforts to maintain ‘community’ during lockdown and remote learning”</li>
  <li>“Models of remote instruction in K-12 schools: synchronous, asynchronous, learning pods, hybrid, and more”</li>
  <li>“Global models of remote education: report from North America, Europe, and Asia”</li>
  <li>“Lab sciences and the lockdown”</li>
</ul>

<p>You paper will gather research that allows you to learn about and fully describe
your topic. Start with newspaper articles and magazine articles (available for
search through the <a href="https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.adelphi.edu/bisacademicresearchhome?crid=d0cc6122-24e3-49d5-8c7a-fa9cc4e362c4&amp;pdmfid=1516831&amp;pdisurlapi=true">Lexis Nexis
database</a>).
You can also incorporate primary sources such as school district announcements,
state agency reports, social media posts from educators/students/parents, etc.
Your paper should be organized into the following sections:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduction: describe the topic, why it’s important, what type of data you gathered</li>
  <li>Analysis: review the news articles, reports, and other data that your
investigation uncovered. Organize and synthesize the findings to offer a
coherent look at the topic. Consider how “remote learning” in practice compares
to our understanding of the best practices for online instruction.</li>
  <li>Conclusion: extend your analysis to point to which approaches to remote
learning were most effective, which should be avoided, and which areas need
further research and refinement.</li>
</ol>

<p>This paper should be a <strong>pair project</strong> – you will work with a partner to research
and write the report.</p>

<p>Your team will submit the written report worth 20 points, and will also upload
a 5-minute video report where you summarize your key findings and explain the core
results of your paper. These videos will be shared with the class for comments
and discussion during weeks</p>

<h3 id="mini-unit">Mini-unit</h3>

<p>The online mini-unit constitutes the biggest part of your grade and is split
into two phases: Prototype and Final Run. Together these will take up roughly
the last four weeks of the semester. During the Prototype phase, you will run a
rough and/or partial version of your mini-unit, and the rest of the class will
enroll as students. We will give you feedback that you will use to revise for
the Final Run, which will have to be polished. You will get feedback again that
you can use to revise it one more time.</p>

<p>The mini-unit is a culmination of all the readings and assignments you did in
this class. It should be a self-contained, complete unit that would take up
roughly 3 hours of a student’s time. This means you shouldn’t have students
watch a 3-hour long video or read a novel, as it would take up too much time;
nor should it be too short. If your unit is intended for a younger audience, let
us know and we can adjust our expectations. The mini-unit can be about something
you might teach in class or it could be something fun that works well as an
online unit. The unit should contain assessment(s) that checks for
understanding. It should also contain some logical progression, so it shouldn’t
be just a single lesson or tutorial. Finally, it should be designed for a
minimum of 15 students. You won’t have that many enrolled in this class but it
should be designed to accommodate at least 15 students.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TlxSJKDV-6JW-5Fc098lPmqVaQn2LIs9bz-kq4xZvvQ">Prototype</a></p>

<p>In Week 11 and 12 we will prototype the courses. Half the class will be teachers
for the week and the other half will be students in three courses. This way each
course will have 3-5 students enrolled. The prototype should focus on the part
of the lesson that is most experimental or has the most most open questions. You
may need to test if your assessment is valid or if your activity instructions
are clear, or whether a video or written instructional material is more
effective. The prototype should be developed enough for us to evaluate whether
it is headed in the right direction and whether it adequately reflects your
understanding of the topics covered in the class. At the very least it should
have activities to do and it should be built on a platform of your choice. As
the unit designer, you will be in charge of running the unit as the instructor.
If you are not presenting that week, then you should enroll in three of your
peers’ units that week; this should give everyone plenty of feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t use Edmodo</strong>: Although some of you may be familiar with Edmodo, the way it is designed makes
it difficult to differentiate between different classes. Here’s one done on
<a href="http://gw730.weebly.com">Weebly</a> that is quite well designed. Students have
also used <a href="https://moodlecloud.com/">Moodle Cloud</a>,
<a href="https://flipgrid.com/">Flipgrid</a>, <a href="https://classroom.google.com/">Google
Classroom</a>,
<a href="https://www.classcraft.com">Classcraft</a>,
<a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/">Canvas</a>, and
<a href="https://www.schoology.com/">Schoology</a> in the past.</p>

<p>Your Prototype will be evaluated based on whether the part you presented was
functional and ready; whether you had sufficient interaction with your students;
and whether it demonstrated an understanding of design principles we discussed,
especially Multimedia Theory and Universal Design. If you are a student, your
participation will be evaluated by the unit designer; this grade will go towards
your participation grade that week. Participating as a student means getting
involved in the activities, not just looking at the website.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EFCDxZjtj4s6aolxtieLJJm1dKHF7Un7G8M_-G6PhF8">Final Run</a></p>

<p>After your Prototype has run, go through the comments you received and list 3-5
of the main, recurring themes that you want to address. As the unit designer,
you can choose to accept or reject any comments, provided you give a rationale.
This should be turned in as part of your Final Run. (Write a summary of the
comments and actions you took, about 500 words).</p>

<p>The Final Run will occur two weeks after you present your Prototype. That
means if you presented your Prototype first, you will do the Final Run first as
well. The upside of that is you will have a lot more time to polish it before
you turn it in. It should be a fully functional mini-unit. Everything—the
activities, the discussions, the assessments—should work. Your evaluation will
be based on whether the mini-unit as a whole was cohesive, had a logical
progression in topics, had meaningful assessments that let students know how
they are doing, was thoughtfully designed and straightforward to navigate.</p>

<p>After your unit has run, collect the feedback again and do any additional
revisions you want. You will turn in the mini-unit at the end of the semester.
As with the Final Run, it should come with a short (1-2 pages double-spaced)
description of what feedback you used or rejected. It should also point me to
any changes you made since the Final Run.</p>

<p><strong>Design Tips</strong></p>

<p>Here are some tips based on previous classes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think about the design: Simplify the way students interact with the course
(e.g., uploading, taking screenshots, clicking around, etc.). Sometimes there
are things within the platform itself that can make navigation easier. Don’t
put the burden of organizing the learning on the students. Instead, do all you
reasonably can to design the learning experience. For example, in this class,
if you’re given a hyperlink to an eBook, the link will take you to the right
page. Little things like this significantly improves the navigation. This
often means more upfront design work on your part, but it’s worth avoiding
confusion or frustration.</li>
  <li>Consider the online context: Your activities shouldn’t try to replicate the
experience of a face-to-face (f2f) class. Think about how the online class
transforms the activity. In some cases, your activity will have to be
re-configured to fit the online environment; in other cases, you may have to
find a different kind of activity.</li>
  <li>Don’t bind yourself to a daily schedule: Online classes don’t need to have a
Monday-through-Friday schedule; they can be self-paced or they can have
interactions that are more spaced out.</li>
  <li>Empathize the student’s journey: Imagine (at least) two kinds of students, one who
will go to one end of the unit and go through it linearly and another who might
skip around and see what’s out there. How will these two students experience it
differently? If your unit is meant to be uni-directional, then design it that
way and make the instructions clear.</li>
  <li>Provide multiple paths: Put your instructions in more than one place so that students
won’t miss them. Make sure they are consistent.</li>
  <li>Make it sustainable: A common flaw in past mini-units is that they were designed
for only the number of students they expected to enroll for this class. There
would often be activities or interactions that clearly won’t accommodate a
larger number. That’s why you’re asked to design it to accommodate at least 15
students.</li>

<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>

<p>This is a graduate course where you are expected to complete weekly readings and
fully participate in discussions in class and on Moodle. In order for the
discussion to flow smoothly online, you should respond to the voicethread and
forum discussion by the dates noted on the syllabus, and spend the remainder of
the week responding to what your peers have posted. Your responses to your peers
should be thoughtful, critical and substantive. Your participation grade will be
based on the timeliness and quality of your posts, your responses to your peers,
and any other activities that might be associated with the week. Your
participation grade is given out on a weekly basis. You can track your
participation grade on Moodle. For each week of the course you will earn either
0 or 1 points for participating in the course activities. In addition to these
15 points, you will have the opportunity to earn and extra 5 bonus points. Bonus
points will be awarded for helping other students, starting discussions with
thoughtful posts, and generally forwarding our shared goals for the course,
beyond the regular class participation.</p>
