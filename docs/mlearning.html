<p><strong>Course description.</strong></p>

<p>Most of the world connects to the Internet from mobile phones, most of the time.
Chromebooks, Android tablets and iPads have made one-to-one computing a reality
in many U.S. school systems. Augmented reality and location based software offer
new opportunities for context aware learning. Students carry significant
computing power in their pockets. This course considers how mobile computing
forces us to reconsider the time and place of learning.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> mlearning, mobile learning, android, ipad, tablet computing, AR, XR, augmented reality</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="weekly-topics">Weekly topics</h2>
<p><strong>Class format.</strong> The class this semester will be taught in a hybrid-flexible
(“hyflex”) format which combines asynchronous online work in some weeks, with
live meetings held synchronously on campus at the Manhattan Center and over
live Zoom video calls. The instructor will always be on campus for the hyflex
sessions. You are invited to join in-person or via Zoom, and are free to change
the format week to week. Regardless of modality, if a session is listed as
“hyflex”, you must plan to be available from 4:30-6:20 on that date.</p>

<p><em>Readings, discussion forums, and other assignments are
available on the course website under the weekly topic.</em></p>

<p><em>Complete the readings <strong>before</strong> the session listed for hylfex weeks so that
you come to class meetings prepared to discuss. For asynchronous weeks, you
should do the readings early in the week so that you can participate in online
activities that draw on them later in the week.</em></p>

<p><strong>Hyflex sessions: Wednesday 4:30-6:20</strong><br />
<small>Manhattan Campus room 274 or zoom</small></p>

<h3 id="session-leader-individual">Session leader (individual)</h3>

<p>You will be responsible for leading a class session this
semester. For async weeks, you will submit (to the instructor) an audio
introduction to the readings and other materials; during hyflex meetings you will
begin the session with a short introduction. Plan for about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>If you are leading an asynchronous class session, you will not submit your own
reading response this week, but will play the role of moderator in our online
discussion. You will ask follow up questions to posts and comments, connect
students who address the same subjects but may not have seen each other, post to
keep discussions on track (and civil if needed), and prompt/nudge your peers who
seem to be falling behind.</p>

<p>If you are leading a live class, you will essentially be the seminar or
workshop leader for that week. You should be very familiar with the readings and
come to class with interesting questions and/or quotations from the texts that
you believe will lead to fruitful discussions.</p>

<h3 id="reading-responses-individual">Reading Responses (individual)</h3>

<p>For most asynchronous weeks you will be asked to post a <em>reading response</em> on Moodle.
This is the main online interaction for this portion of this course. Your
reading response should be approximately 500 words, but occasionally
may call for more or less.</p>

<p>A good reading response:</p>

<ol>
  <li>specifically refers to the readings and other activities due that week: you will usually want to quote the texts and refer to specific passages,</li>
  <li>your post will start a new thread in our discussion forum, it should have its own unique (and clever) title,</li>
  <li>is not a <em>summary</em>, you should have a point of view and express your own synthesis, understanding, and opinion about the topic under discussion,</li>
  <li>sometimes this will relate to courses you are taking now, your work, or your personal life,</li>
  <li>sometimes this will relate to other things you have read or studied (this is okay, just give us a little bit of reference and a way to find more information),</li>
  <li>is not a formal, academic post (you don’t need APA style references), but you should include links, titles, authors names, etc for outside readings/videos/works,</li>
  <li><em>is</em> intended for this course and your classmates so it should be <strong>professional</strong> in substance and tone, and</li>
  <li><strong>is posted on time</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The general workflow for these online weeks follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>(Wed-Sat) Do course readings</li>
  <li>(Sat-Mon) Write &amp; post a reading response</li>
  <li>(Tues-Wed) Read all of the responses and post comments/discuss</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to your own response, you should check the discussion board regularly.
You are required to comment on at least two of your
peer’s responses each week and you should respond to
people who engage with you.</p>

<h3 id="tech-report-pair">Tech Report (pair)</h3>

<p>Working in pairs, you will present a “Tech Report” on an aspect of mobile
technology. Teams will prepare 10 minute presentation they will deliver in
class. In the Moodle forum, each team will post a 1-paragraph abstract of their
presentation and an annotated list of resources (e.g. websites, press, and
scholarly articles) related to their topic. Annotations should only be a few
sentences. The report does not need to include academic or experimental articles,
but should give a general overview of the technology (how and where it works)
as well as the latest state of the art of the field.</p>

<p>Choose one of these technologies for your report:</p>

<ol>
  <li>indoor location systems (bluetooth beacons, etc)</li>
  <li>mobile payments (Google Wallet, Apple Pay, Alipay, etc)</li>
  <li>Augmented reality (AR) headsets, glasses, etc</li>
  <li>mesh networks</li>
  <li>wireless/mobile encryption and security</li>
  <li>wearable computing (other than AR sets)</li>
</ol>

<p>This project is worth 10 points. Your report should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>describe the technical details of the topic in a way that’s easily understood</li>
  <li>use video, sound, images as needed</li>
  <li>describe the main ways the tech is currently being used and its potential uses</li>
  <li>summarize why the technology may or may not be important</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="app-inventor-app-1-individual">App Inventor app 1 (individual)</h3>
<p>You will design, develop, and test a mobile app built with
MIT’s <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">app inventor software</a>, which allows you
to make mobile Android apps without writing any text-based code. For this assignment
you will conceive of, design, and code a “simple” educational app with app inventor.
The app will be “simple” because it will not have to use any advanced features
such as having users log in, accessing internet resources, allowing for multi-user
interactions, etc.</p>

<p>To design your project, think of a useful mobile app for teaching or learning.
Start with a “problem” that you can describe, and then think of solutions to
that problem that are a good fit for what we know about mobile technologies and
mobile learning. If there’s an existing, better solution to what you’re
proposing, you can either think of a way to improve it, or move on to a new
idea. When you create your design, prioritize the most important features. You
are only going to build a prototype – a working software application that can
be tested and refined.</p>

<p>This project is worth 20 points and will be scored according to this scale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5 points: learning framework (why does the concept make sense in terms of mobile learning?)</li>
  <li>5 points: originality of the concept</li>
  <li>5 points: quality of the “code”</li>
  <li>5 points: quality of the usability / user experience</li>
</ul>

<p>To submit this project, you will create a video screencast (5-8 minutes) where you demonstrate the “code” and how it’s organized, and then show the
app running on a mobile device.
[<a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9075928?hl=en">Record the screen on Android</a>]
[<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935">Record the screen on iOS</a>]</p>

<p>Submit a link to the screencast and the exported app inventor project files.</p>

<h3 id="app-inventor-app-2-team">App Inventor app 2 (team)</h3>

<p>Building on the skills and ideas from your first app inventor project, you will
join a team (3-5 people) to build a larger, more complex mobile app for learning
using the App Inventor platform. This second app should be more ambitious than
the first one. You might want to include location or map data, voice
recognition, multi-user support, storing information on the device, etc. It can
be an extension of a previous project, or can be something designed from
scratch.</p>

<p>This project is worth 25 points and will be scored according to this scale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 points: learning framework (why does the concept make sense in terms of mobile learning?)</li>
  <li>5 points: originality of the concept</li>
  <li>5 points: quality of the “code”</li>
  <li>5 points: quality of the usability / user experience</li>
</ul>

<p>This second project should have a more robust learning framework that incorporates the various approaches to mobile learning that we have learned this semester. When you submit the project, you will include a <strong>written conceptual framework</strong> (500-800 words) that describes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the problem being solved</li>
  <li>why existing solutions are not sufficient</li>
  <li>why your proposed solution is based on solid learning theory and instructional design</li>
  <li>why a mobile solution is the right solution for the problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Your team will submit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the written framework</li>
  <li>a 5 minute <em>team</em> video explaining the goals of the app and showing it in use;
reflect on what worked well and what still needs further development</li>
  <li><em>individual</em> videos from each team members that walk through the code that
team member worked on primarily</li>
</ul>

<p>One team member must submit a link to the screencast and the exported app inventor project files. Everyone</p>

<h3 id="mini-literature-review-individual">Mini literature review (individual)</h3>

<p>For this assignment you will write a brief review of literature about how mobile
technologies are used in a specific domain of learning. Broadly, your review
should focus on a subject area (e.g. mathematics, language learning, teacher
professional development) or target group/setting (e.g. students with
disabilities, higher education, museum education, ENL students). You should read and review
the most important scholarly articles in your topic area. This must
include articles that do not describe <em>mobile learning</em>, but discuss the state
of the art knowledge of the field. For example, if you choose to write about
“mobile technologies in museum education,” you must include a brief overview of the
key goals and techniques of museum education in general. From there, you will review
the research on mlearning for museums.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/conducting_research/writing_a_literature_review.html">Purdue University Online Writing Lab (OWL) guide to writing a
literature
review</a>
to gain a better understanding of what is expected for this assignment.
Typically, a literature review will be <em>exaustive</em> – in that it covers all of
the public research on the topic. Your review can be selective, where you review
the 5-10 <strong>most important</strong> articles published on your topic.</p>
