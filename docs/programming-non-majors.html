<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> computer programming, CS1, python, computational thinking,
critical computational literacy</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This course introduces students to programming and  some core
concepts of computer science, using a modern, object oriented programming
language (currently Python). Students learn concepts of  variables, functions,
repetition/loops, basic data structures  (arrays, lists, hashtables), and
basic object oriented programming. They also consider the role of computation,
software, and technology in our society.</p>

<h2 id="grading-structure">Grading structure</h2>

<p>Assignment              Pct
——————-     ——-
Participation           10%
Quizzes                 20%
Midterm                 30%
Final Exam              40%</p>

<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>Students are expected to attend every class session, to come prepared having
done the reading and practice exercises, and to participate fully: working
individually, in pairs, and in teams during in-class lab activities.</p>

<h2 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h2>
<p>There will be 10 quizzes which will be completed  individually at the start of
class. Quizzes consist of 2 short  answer programming questions drawn directly
from the reading for the  week. Quizzes are designed to be passed easily by
students who are  keeping up with the reading and the concepts in the course,
and will  help students and the instructor maintain a good pace for the
development of the course. All quizzes will be open book/open computer.
Students can use the internet to read documentation and can use PyCharm, IDLE,
and other tools to test their code. No communication with other students is
allowed, and no direct help from outsiders will be allowed during quizzes.
Quizzes will be timed and work will be submitted “as is” when time expires.</p>

<h2 id="midterm">Midterm</h2>
<p>There will be an in-class midterm for this course on Thursday of Week 8. The midterm
will require most/all of the available class time. The exam will consist of a
short answer section as well as a full program which will likely require
several functions to solve. There will be no partial credit for short answers.
The full program will be scored with partial credit. Students will choose from
one of two possible problems for the long-answer. The exam will be “open
book”—students can use their notes, online resources, the course text, code
examples from class, etc. The only exception is that real-time communication
between students, or between students and outside parties is prohibited during
the exam (i.e. no Slack, IM, texting, IRC, posting new questions to forums,
etc).</p>

<h2 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h2>

<p>The midterm will test students’ abilities to synthesize the various aspects of
computer programming to solve problems creatively. There will be no short
answer questions. Students will choose one of several challenges to answer.
They will write one complete program that offers a solution to the problem.
The problems will not have a single, “right” answer, rather they will require
analysis and creative thinking on the part of the students. Their solution
will be evaluated on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>15 points, code:</strong> is the code efficient and elegant? do students demonstrate effective use of Python functions, libraries, and data structures? is the code organized into functions? does it use function parameters for abstraction and to make code reusable?</li>
  <li><strong>10 points, solution:</strong> how well does the program solve the problem? does it work in all cases? to what degree is it bug free?</li>
  <li><strong>10 points, creativity and risk:</strong> does the program offer a creative solution to the problem? does the student demonstrate that they have studied programming outside of class? are they able to read documentation to incorporate new ideas into their work?</li>
  <li><strong>5 points, style:</strong> is the code well formatted with white space? are functions and variables named clearly and concisely? are comments used where needed and omitted when not?</li>
</ul>
