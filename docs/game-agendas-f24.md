**Game of the week: Zork I**

[Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) is a text-adventure / interactive fiction game
that was created in the late 1970s and then released for personal computers in 1980.
It builds on the even earlier adventure game, _Colossal Cave Adventure_. Both games
are pioneers in the new types of storytelling that games could make possible. In
today's terms it is part puzzle game, part interactive fiction. You can play Zork
on the web (for free) and there are plenty of hint/cheat sites if you feel the need.

- **Play here:** [Zork I https://textadventures.co.uk/games/play/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq](https://textadventures.co.uk/games/play/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq)
  - You can save your game by typing `save` and then load it with `restore`
  - Since it's running the browser, you will need to be in the same browser 
    (not private, without clearing cookies/cache) to load your saved game.
- Play Zork I for one hour
- Post your score and how far you got on Discord
- Play more if you want!


**Do**

1. Video and Readings
2. Play Zork
3. (Optional) Play a "modern" interactive fiction game
   ([like one of these](https://itch.io/games/made-with-twine))
4. Post once, comment twice in the Narrative Forum.

**Choose your game of the week:**

1. [Ace Attorney](https://www.ace-attorney.com/) [Win & Console]
2. [Undertale](https://undertale.com/) [Win, Mac, Linux, PS4, Switch] 
3. [Doki Doki Literature Club](https://ddlc.moe/) [Win, Mac, Linux]

These are more modern, story-driven games. Look at all three, and choose
the one that you want to play and learn more about. This week, I would
like you to play **the game for at least 2 hours**. One hour isn't
enough time to experience the unique elements. Of course, you are welcome
to play longer. _Doki Doki_ is free, the other two appear to be on sale
for around $10. I bought them on [STEAM](https://store.steampowered.com/).

**Do**

1. Start the game
2. Do the readings
3. Play more of the game
4. Post once, comment twice in the Design Forum. _Note: two prompts this week._

Costikiyan: I have no words
---------------------------

In your own words, explain what Greg Costikyan means by each of the following, in terms of game design:

- interaction
- struggle
- endogenous
- (any two elements of LeBlanc, as described by Costikyan)

Narrative Games

Referring to _Zork I_ and the game that you chose this week, write a game analysis essay
(~400-500 words) on one of the following themes:

1. Agency and player choice
2. Flow, challenge, and frustration
3. Character, story, and drama
