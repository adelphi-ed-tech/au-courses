**Goals**

- understand the idea of narrative and narratalogy in games studies
- discover the ways that story drives games

**Listen to the Week 4 Overview**


**Game of the week: Zork I**

[Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) is a text-adventure / interactive fiction game
that was created in the late 1970s and then released for personal computers in 1980.
It builds on the even earlier adventure game, _Colossal Cave Adventure_. Both games
are pioneers in the new types of storytelling that games could make possible. In
today's terms it is part puzzle game, part interactive fiction. You can play Zork
on the web (for free) and there are plenty of hint/cheat sites if you feel the need.

  - You can save your game by typing `save` and then load it with `restore`
  - Since it's running the browser, you will need to be in the same browser
