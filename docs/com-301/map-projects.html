<h2 id="map-analysis--skills-project-1-20">Map Analysis &amp; Skills Project #1 (20%)</h2>

<h3 id="part-1-mapping-points">Part 1: Mapping Points</h3>

<p>In this assignment you will show your ability to plot “points” on an 
interactive map and to use HTML and CSS to create multimedia content 
at each point. You will also examine a map of your choosing in terms 
of data and storytelling. Your map will tell a story about the high 
school you graduated from and the surrounding area. Your map must have 
at least 4 points with an HTML pop-up. One of the points must be the 
location of your school, the other points might be other schools, 
locations of importance to you and your educational background, areas 
of community interest, historic sites, etc. There is no 
strict rule as to what you choose to include in your map!</p>

<h4 id="your-html-pop-ups-must-include-the-following">Your HTML pop-ups must include the following:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Use of HTML components and CSS to provide structure and layout of your page</li>
  <li>At least one static image (photo or illustration)</li>
  <li>At least one embedded video or audio file</li>
  <li>CSS to style the text on your pop-up</li>
  <li>Use of background colors, images, or gradients</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="to-receive-full-points-for-this-assignment-you-must">To receive full points for this assignment you must:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate your ability to use relevant documentation by 
including a technique that was not explicitly
demonstrated in class or example</li>
  <li>Use the general skills of HTML and CSS development to 
communicate your overall message</li>
  <li>Must be turned in on time ( before class on 2/12) by sending 
a code sandbox link to your map code. The
link should be posted to the #Project1 channel.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="part-2-map-analysis">Part 2: Map Analysis</h3>
<p>For your map investigation, you will choose a map that represents data about a particular region.</p>

<h4 id="your-map-investigation-200-words-must-include">Your Map Investigation (~200 words) must include:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The map you chose (including a link)</li>
  <li>A summary and discussion of:
    <ul>
      <li>Who created it</li>
      <li>What its purpose is</li>
      <li>What data it includes and that data’s source</li>
      <li>Speculation about what other kinds of data could help us 
understand the issue the map is addressing</li>
      <li>What story or version of the world it is advancing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This summary should be sent as a DM to Professor Drew on Discord by 2/12 before class.</li>
</ul>

<p>To submit assignment one, share your codesandbox as a public or unlisted project with Dr. Drew as a Direct Message on Discord.
Share your map investigation as a Google Doc with Dr. Drew.</p>

<h2 id="assignment-2-map-analysis--skills-project-2-20">Assignment #2: Map Analysis &amp; Skills Project #2 (20%)</h2>

<p>For the second assignment you will build upon the
map you created in your first assignment. Your map should
be based on the <a href="map-markers.html">“map markers” example code</a>
which uses a Javascript array (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">point.js</code>) to define the
data for your map points.</p>

<h3 id="part-1-school-map-ii">Part 1: School Map II</h3>

<p>The focus of this assignment is to use your technical and design
skills to tell a story about your high school and the surrounding
community. <em>What</em> story you tell is up to you.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum requirements:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of points (and points with pop-ups) is up to you
— however many you need to tell your story</li>
  <li>your map must have a legend</li>
  <li>your map must contain at least 3 different kinds of markers</li>
  <li>at least one marker must be a custom marker</li>
  <li>you must have at least one custom icon</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What we want to see:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>your <strong>project</strong> is organized:
    <ul>
      <li>you don’t have “extra” files or code</li>
      <li>your resources are organized into folders (all of your images are in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">img</code> folder, etc.)</li>
      <li>files are named correctly and consistently</li>
      <li>file names have “semantic” meaning – the <em>name</em> of the file tells you what’s in it. <em>Don’t: keep a file called dumplings.html which is a pop-up for your high school.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>you have a good understanding of HTML:
    <ul>
      <li>tags are opened and closed correctly</li>
      <li>containers are not overlapping
        <ul>
          <li>don’t: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>your code is neat and organized
        <ul>
          <li>all tags and attributes are lowercase</li>
          <li>properties are in quotes</li>
          <li>you don’t have “extra” markup (tags that don’t do anything)</li>
          <li>try to keep indentation consistent (indent for each child element)</li>
          <li>for a full guide (optional) see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/HTML">Mozilla’s style guide</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>you looked up tags not in our examples and learned how to use them correctly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>you have a good understanding of <strong>CSS</strong> mechanics:
    <ul>
      <li>you add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class</code> attributes to HTML as needed</li>
      <li>you re-use css classes when necessary</li>
      <li>you understand css selectors</li>
      <li>you don’t repeat styles, but use them in combination</li>
      <li>you have challenged yourself to learn new techniques on your own</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>you can create a consistent <strong>design</strong> to support your story
    <ul>
      <li>your CSS creates a consistent look and feel</li>
      <li>you use typography and color to make your design legible
and convey meaning</li>
      <li>you can find or create icons and images that have
a consistent style and match the aesthetic of your map</li>
      <li>you add media (images, audio, video) to support your story</li>
      <li>you don’t clutter your map with irrelevant information</li>
      <li>your “copy” (text, scripts for media, labels) is
well-written, clear, and error free</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>design <strong>process</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>you build from goals for your design (i.e. your map)</li>
      <li>study sources of inspiration and previous work to
inform your design for this type of project</li>
      <li>you imagine who your users are, what they want to know,
and how they will use your map</li>
      <li>you start with sketches, outlines, and other
low-fidelity design tools</li>
      <li>you show your work (to anyone who will look at it!) 
early and frequently for feedback</li>
      <li>you get help when needed</li>
      <li>you revise your work based on feedback</li>
      <li>you re-design (“refactor”) your work to simplify it and
make it easier to change and maintain</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="part-2-designers-statement">Part 2: Designer’s Statement</h3>

<ol>
  <li>What is the title of your work?</li>
  <li>What do you intend for audiences to see, experience, and think about
when viewing your map? What do you hope they take away from the
experience of interacting with your map?</li>
  <li>What kinds of social issues does your map explore, if any? If not,
what social issues <em>could</em> you explore in a future map that builds on what you learned by making this one?</li>
  <li>What were some of the design choices you made in terms of look 
and feel? Why did you make those choices?</li>
  <li>Which are the most successful aspects of your map/what do 
you like most about it/what are you most proud of about it?</li>
  <li>Did you encounter any difficulties when creating your map? 
How did you work through them?</li>
  <li>Is there anything about your map that you now think you should 
have done differently? If so, please explain what and why.</li>
