                    <p>The <em>integrated thesis project</em> of the
                    Master’s of Arts in Educational Technology is the
                    culminating experience of a student’s time in the
                    program, and displays the range of new knowledge and
                    abilities they have acquired during their
                    studies.</p>
                    <p>All thesis projects:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>reflect a deep understanding of the research
                    around educational technology and instructional
                    design</li>
                    <li>address a specific issue or problem of
                    significance and importance to the student</li>
                    <li>produce a “professional” level work</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There is no fixed format for the <em>project</em>
                    — we encourage creative and innovative ideas.
                    Frequently, thesis projects fall into one of these
                    broad categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>production of a mutlimedia or interactive
                    educational artifact (e.g. a game, mobile app,
                    website, data visualization, animation, or
                    video)</li>
                    <li>design of curriculum, teaching resources, or
                    scholastic program integrating digital
                    technologies</li>
                    <li>a theoretical paper that forwards an original
                    idea or concept related to educational
                    technology</li>
                    <li>an empirical study that tests a research
                    hypothesis related to educational technology</li>
                    <li>a research project that is part of ongoing
                    research being conducted by one of the Educational
                    Technology faculty or partners</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Projects vary and should be designed in
                    collaboration with the student’s advisor. The best
                    projects focus on an area of intense interest to the
                    student, and serve to forward the students’
                    professional goals; whether those goals are to
                    change careers, advance in their current profession,
                    or continue studying at the doctoral level.</p>

                    <h2>Registering for the thesis project</h2>
                    <p>You do not register for EDT 793 through CLASS.
                    You must register by submitting a proposal to your
                    advisor by completing the <a
                    href="https://forms.gle/ooL32gZX4QNYBBL57"><strong>EDT
                    793 Thesis Proposal Form</strong></a>.</p>
                    <p>Often, the best way to start a proposal is to
                    send a few ideas to your advisor. Think about:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>what technologies you wan to work with and learn
                    more about (e.g. augmented reality, data
                    visualization, interactive video)</li>
                    <li>think about what domain or population you are
                    interested in serving (e.g. science education, adult
                    learners, early childhood, literacy)</li>
                    <li>consider what you will produce at the end, and
                    you will use it:
                    <ul>
                    <li>multimedia or software that is part of your
                    portfolio</li>
                    <li>a new course or program that can be used in your
                    school</li>
                    <li>a report or paper that is useful where you
                    work</li>
                    <li>an scholarly article that can be submitted for
                    professional or academic publications, or used as a
                    writing sample for PhD programs</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can start writing down 3-5 different ideas,
                    sharing them with friends and mentors, and sending
                    them to your faculty advisor(s). These ideas can
                    start the conversation around your thesis project
                    and lead to the eventual proposal.</p>

                    <h2>Completing the thesis project</h2>
                    <p>The thesis project is completed individually.
                    There are no class meetings or regularly scheduled
                    assignments. Your adviser will help you set goals,
                    create a timeline, and provide guidance and feedback
                    as needed. The thesis is <strong>pass /
                    fail</strong> — you should present periodic
                    drafts/prototypes to your adviser to ensure that you

<h2>The Center for Academic Support and Enrichment (CASE; formerly The Learning and Writing Centers)</h2>
<p>
CASE programs and services--like individual tutoring in writing and subjects across the
curriculum, small group study sessions, academic coaching, and targeted workshops--help
students explore, deepen, and extend their classroom learning. Support programming focuses
on establishing foundational skills and techniques of studentship, like time management and
note-taking. Enrichment services develop higher-order critical thinking skills and problem solving
skills inherent in both abstractions and applications of curricular study.

<h2>The Adelphi Honor Code</h2>
<p>
  The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to
  this pursuit is academic integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s
  Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to uphold the principles of honesty and civility
  embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth and honesty and I will
  forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h3>Code of Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying,
cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation
  marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to
  produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized
  collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is
  plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-
  generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of
  plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as
  ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or
  otherwise) for student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are,
  please reach out to me to discuss it as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic
  integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review and could result in
  disciplinary action. <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty</a>.
</p>

<h2>Diversity statement</h2>
We value human dignity and diversity in all forms, embrace our differences, and honor all
voices. We understand the collective power inherent in fully inclusive communities where each
may meet their full potential to contribute.


<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that
the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and
students are strongly encouraged to respond. Please be assured that your responses are
anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after course grades have
been submitted after the semester ends.

<h2>Religious observance policy</h2>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious
observances. Students who anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are
required by Adelphi University to notify their professors at the start of the semester. This will
allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their course exam and
assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on
those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment
deadline missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out
suitable arrangements for make-ups or other satisfaction of academic requirements.
