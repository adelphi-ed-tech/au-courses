<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> visual culture, media studies, multimedia</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This course focuses on the 
philosophy of visual media, with a pragmatic approach 
to understanding visual culture in our society: schools, youth media, 
mass media, etc. Students study theories of visuality
and multimodal semiotics. They write philosophical 
critiques of current media, and develop original media projects 
informed by course readings.</p>

<p><strong>Cylce 2:</strong> Nov. 1 — Jan. 12</p>

<h2 id="goals-and-objectives">Goals and Objectives</h2>

<p>The course provides students with a broad historical perspective of the
philosophical positions on the role of technology in society. In
addition to understanding how technology is used, students should also
be aware of how it changes our relation to mind, perception, reality and
society.</p>

<p>By the end of the course, students should be able to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Understand major topics in philosophy of technology</li>
  <li>Apply a philosophical lens to critique current and emerging
technologies</li>
  <li>Compare and contrast different philosophical traditions and
synthesize them to make coherent arguments and assess the role of
technology in society</li>
  <li>Understand various positions (e.g. feminist, anti-technology, post-colonial)
and why they are relevant to the development and use of educational
technology</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="assignments-and-grading">Assignments and Grading</h2>

<h3 id="educational-media-studio-50">Educational Media Studio (50%)</h3>

<p>Working from a visuality and media literacy perspective, students
will develop a substantial educational media project with explicit
instructional value. Students will choose their own audience for this
work: both the target age and ability level, as well as the domain
and content for instruction.</p>

<p>Regardless of the content, the work <em>must</em> pay explicit attention to
the aesthetic and semantic content of the work, beyond the instructional
value.</p>

<p>Acceptable media for this project include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>original digital or analog games for learning</li>
  <li>websites, web applications, or mobile (web) apps</li>
  <li>interactive SMARTBoard lessons</li>
  <li>original instructional video or audio (video can be animated, live
action, screencasts, or a combination)</li>
</ul>

<p>Along with the educational media, each student will turn in a ~300
word reflection where they indicate the goals of their project in
terms of visual culture and media literacy, and discuss their
successes and difficulties in meeting these goals.</p>

<p>The media project will be evaluated in each of the following criteria,
with a possible 10 points available for each area of evaluation:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Aesthetics</em>: is the the work visually appealing? does it use visual
metaphors and “visuality” to make it more powerful and appealing? does
the author carefully use color and composition?</li>
  <li><em>Learning sciences</em>: in what ways does the author draw on the best
practices for how people learn and how people learn from visual media?</li>
  <li><em>Curriculum</em>: how does the project meet the stated curricular goals?
does it address an important learning goal for the target audience?
does the scale of the media match the learning goals? i.e., does the media
focus on the most important or most challening apsects to teach?</li>
  <li><em>Technqique</em>: how well does the author demonstrate his/her facility with
the given media? for example, do SMARTBoard lessons take advantage of the
diverse tools available in the Notebook software? are digital images cropped
and scaled “cleanly”? does the author demonstrate the ability to compose
text and images?</li>
  <li><em>Reflection</em>: does the reflective paper clearly state the goals for the project?
does the author clearly articulate the reasons for the choices in the project?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="visuality-in-educational-media-or-youth-media-50">Visuality in Educational Media or Youth Media (50%)</h3>

<p>Students will choose a work of educational media and write a critique
based on the course readings. The essay should connect to the
visuality of course themes, as they are represented in the media
being studied. Themes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>media and violence</li>
  <li>bodies and difference</li>
  <li>visuality of power, coloniality, and empire</li>
  <li>markets, attention, and visual media</li>
  <li>mediation</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, this paper should draw from at least four different essays from
the <em>The visual culture reader</em> as well as <em>Media literacy in the K-12
classroom</em>.</p>

<p>Suitable media:</p>

<ul>
  <li>illustrated text books</li>
  <li>illustrated children’s literature</li>
  <li>“multimedia” textbooks (such as iBooks)</li>
  <li>youth magazines</li>
  <li>video games (educational or otherwise)</li>
  <li>children’s/youth television or films (e.g. PBS, Nickelodian)</li>
  <li>educational “apps” or websites</li>
  <li>educational video or documentaries</li>
  <li>SMARTBoard lessons</li>
</ul>

<p>This assignment must be between 4,000 and 5,000 words, and be written
following the style and citation format of the APA.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment criteria:</strong></p>

<p>argument
  ~ does the author state a clear proposition? is the argument
    supported with relevant examples and references to scholarship?
    is the topic explored with depth and rigor?</p>

<p>style
  ~ is the paper clear and straightforward? is it organized
    in a way that engages the reader? does sections flow together
    and build towards a cohesive essay? is the manuscript properly
    prepared according to the scholarly standards of the APA?</p>

<p>relevance
  ~ what is at stake in this paper? does the essay engage with current
    and important themes in the field of visual studies? with the 
    pragmatic approach of this course inm mind, does the author 
    adequately connect the scholarly themes of the paper with the 
    lived experience of people in the world?</p>
