                <p class="card-text">Video games have become an increasingly important source  of culture and entertainment in our society. They are  more popular than Hollywood movies, yet receive a fraction  of the attention, especially in academia. In recent years,  this has been changing, as scholars have begun to interrogate  games from many levels: design, critique, and as a means of  learning. In this course, we really have 3 separate,  but overlapping goals: 1) to understand video games  as a social and cultural phenomenon, especially  important to youth culture; 2) to think of ways  to teach _about_ video games, as part of a (digital)  literacy perspective; and 3) to investigate ways  to teach with games, both off the shelf and ones  that we design ourselves.
