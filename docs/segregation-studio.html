                    <p>Each semester the multimedia studio features a different challenge, dealing with an important, global topic. Students will be asked to work on a semester long multimedia project that teaches some aspect of this challenge.</p>
                    <p>The Spring 2021 Studio theme is <strong>school segregation</strong>, with an initial focus on the New York City public schools. Racially segregated schools may initially appear to be a thing of the (recent) past, but the issue persists as a recalcitrant, multifaceted problem in our contemporary society – both as an impediment to educational equity and excellence, and an obstacle to social equality and justice.</p>

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>This course is designed to challenge students to develop their abilities as instructional designers and as authors and producers of digital media for learning. Specifically, they should learn to:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>design an effective digital learning environment that is intuitive to use and follows principles of Universal Design for Learning</li>
                    <li>develop in-depth skill in one area of digital production: video editing, graphic design, game design, computer programming, web design, etc.</li>
                    <li>understand key concepts of instructional design, including meeting the needs of the target audience, assessing learning outcomes, and following sound and ethical pedagogical principles</li>
                    <li>think creatively about far-reaching challenges in teaching and learning</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>At the end of the studio, every student will have a high quality, published multimedia artifact that will be part of their portfolio.</p>

                    <p>The “briefing” session will help us develop our domain knowledge of school segregation. You will choose a specific topic of your choice related to segregation and then create a 3-minute briefing report – a narrated slide show on your topic. We will watch your presentation in class and then have time for some follow up questions regarding your topic. In addition to your slideshow, you will also post the bibliography used to create your briefing. You should have at least 3 sources, one of them being an academic source. The specific topic of your briefing will probably relate to the aspect of school segregation that you will highlight in your multimedia project.</p>

                    <h3>Multimedia on multimedia</h3>
                    <p>Working with a partner (or group of 3), you will create a multimedia slideshow that demonstrates the key multimedia cognition concepts covered in 2 chapters of <em>Cognitive Load Theory</em> (Plass et al., 2010) or <em>E-Learning and the Science of Instruction</em> (Clark &amp; Mayer, 2016). The books are available online from the Adelphi Library. The total presentation must be between 10-15 minutes long. You are only required to read the chapter for the week you are presenting, but everyone is encouraged to read the chapters. You should supplement your presentation with outside readings and examples as necessary. You should actively work to implement the multimedia principles you are discussing in the design of your presentation. If you are presenting during a synchronous zoom meeting, you should prepare some questions and prompts to facilitate a discussion. If your team is working with an asynchronous class, you will post your questions and prompts in a moddle forum, and you will be responsible for moderating the discussion. Discussion moderation includes reading all posts promptly, responding with feedback and follow up questions, and pointing posters to similar (or conflicting) ideas in other threads.</p>

                    <h3>Workshops: multimedia tutorial</h3>
                    <p>You will be working alone for your multimedia workshop. For this project you will create a “how to” or series of “how to” videos that feature a specific multimedia authoring technique and tool. Choose a multimedia authoring tool that you know well or want to become expert in. Design a 10-15 minute tutorial that describes how (and why/when) to use it. Your video should be in the format of a “quickstart” that isn’t comprehensive, but demonstrates the key skills that you think the rest of us should know to get started. Some of the tools have room for than one workshop, in this case, one presenter will work on the quickstart video and the other will feature more advanced topics.Every workshop must also include a curated list of documentation and other high quality tutorials.</p>
                    <p>Please post your tutorial(s)on YouTube and post the link in our “multimedia tutorial” discussion forum (with its own title). Also post the links to docs and other tutorials here. Monitor the forum for feedback and questions regarding your tool.</p>

                    <p>The culminating work for this class is your <em>multimedia project</em>. Everyone will work on their own individual project. They will produce a multimedia work that demonstrates their skills as a designer and producer of multimedia, their knowledge of the studio topic, and their understanding of the learning sciences of multimedia.</p>
                    <p>You should begin thinking about your project during the first week of class. Consider:</p>

                    <li>is the design accessible?
                    <ul>
                    <li>does it support the widest possible range of computer systems (including OS, web browser, screen size/mobile, processor speed, internet connection quality)</li>

<h2>The Center for Academic Support and Enrichment (CASE; formerly The Learning and Writing Centers)</h2>
<p>
CASE programs and services--like individual tutoring in writing and subjects across the
curriculum, small group study sessions, academic coaching, and targeted workshops--help
students explore, deepen, and extend their classroom learning. Support programming focuses
on establishing foundational skills and techniques of studentship, like time management and
note-taking. Enrichment services develop higher-order critical thinking skills and problem solving
skills inherent in both abstractions and applications of curricular study. 
</p>

<h2>The Adelphi Honor Code</h2>
<p>
  The University is an academic community devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. Fundamental to
  this pursuit is academic integrity. In joining the Adelphi community I accept the University’s
  Statement of Academic Integrity and pledge to uphold the principles of honesty and civility
  embodied in it. I will conduct myself in accordance with ideals of truth and honesty and I will
  forthrightly oppose actions which would violate these ideals.
</p>
<h3>Code of Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>
The Code of Academic Honesty prohibits behavior that can broadly be described as lying,
cheating, or stealing. Violations of the Code of Academic Honesty will include, but not be limited
to, the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fabricating data or citations</li>
  <li>Collaborating in areas not approved by the professor</li>
  <li>Unauthorized multiple submission of one’s own work</li>
  <li>Sabotage of others’ work, including library vandalism or manipulation</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>The creation of unfair advantage</li>
  <li>The facilitation of dishonesty</li>
  <li>Tampering with or falsifying records</li>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Other forms of academic dishonesty</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Copying and pasting from any source into your assignments or exams without quotation
  marks, citations and references, constitutes plagiarism. Students are expected to
  produce and submit original work and to cite all sources appropriately. Unauthorized
  collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone else’s work as your own, is
  plagiarism. Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site (AI-
  generated content, e.g. ChatGPT) without attribution or authorization is also a form of
  plagiarism. Unless explicitly stated, artificial intelligence-based technologies, such as
  ChatGPT or word mixing software, cannot be used to generate responses (partial or
  otherwise) for student assignments or exams.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about what plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty are,
  please reach out to me to discuss it as soon as possible. An allegation of an academic
  integrity violation of this section may be referred for further review and could result in
  disciplinary action. <a href="https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty/">https://www.adelphi.edu/conduct/academic-dishonesty</a>.
</p>

<h2>Diversity statement</h2>
We value human dignity and diversity in all forms, embrace our differences, and honor all
voices. We understand the collective power inherent in fully inclusive communities where each
may meet their full potential to contribute.


<h2>Student Course Evaluations</h2>
During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and eCampus, that
the course evaluation is available for your input electronically. Your feedback is valuable and
students are strongly encouraged to respond. Please be assured that your responses are
anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after course grades have
been submitted after the semester ends.

<h2>Religious observance policy</h2>
Adelphi University welcomes diversity in its community, and respects various religious
observances. Students who anticipate being absent, due to their religious observance, are
required by Adelphi University to notify their professors at the start of the semester. This will
allow the faculty to take these observances into consideration in light of their course exam and
assignment schedules. Students absent from class, clinical experiences, practice, labs, etc. on
those days, after prior notice to the professor, will not be penalized for any exam or assignment
deadline missed because of those absences. Students must contact the instructor to work out
suitable arrangements for make-ups or other satisfaction of academic requirements.
