During this process, participants can learn how to use Scratch to create their own animations and apply them to 
their own disciplines.</p>

<h2 id="graffiti-circuits">Graffiti Circuits</h2>
<p>This workshop will be utilizing an alternative material, circuit scribe, which is a conductive ink. Workshop 
attendees will be creating speakers using this ink, paper, and an amplifier, which I will be providing. I will 
be using this technology to speak on Circuits, currents, the magnetic field the current generates and the 
resulting vibrations, all of the main components of how any speaker works. The goal of the workshop is to create 
a circuit that expresses how they feel about a desired song, while also bringing efficiency to design.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-incorporate-making--using-makey-makeys-in-the-classroom">How to Incorporate Making:  Using Makey Makeys in the Classroom</h2>
<p>In my workshop I will be introducing to the participants how to incorporate making into their classroom using 
makey makeys, they will build on an interactive poster about an ecosystem. Based on the already present poster 
they will choose an organism and do research on the organism and then use scratch to make a code about the 
organism that will pair with the makey makey to bring our poster to like.</p>

your own bioplastic.</p>

<h2 id="narrate-your-own-interactive-posters">Narrate Your Own Interactive Posters</h2>
<p>Models, diagrams, and drawings can come to life with the use of a touch board and electric paint. Touch boards are microcontroller boards that, when connected to speakers, can play sounds off a reloadable microSD card. Electric paint is a non-toxic paint that conducts electricity and can be used to draw circuitry to a touch board. The combination of these technologies allow users to add captions/ sound effects to any drawing or diagram. In this workshop participants will be able to draw a body model and add captions to narrate how different organs function to help maintain homeostasis during strenuous exercise.</p>

<h2 id="ecology-raspberry-pi-twitter-bot">Ecology Raspberry-Pi Twitter-Bot</h2>
<p>Understanding of ecology has become more important as we experience climate change and its impact. Ecology can lead us to ideas and solutions on how we may maintain and improve our environment, manage existing resources and develop new resources, and continue to successfully adapt to new changes because it provides insight into the interaction between biotic and abiotic factors in our environment and how humans and other living organisms influence one another. In this workshop, we will utilize the Raspberry Pi to monitor living and non-living factors in our environment and share that information via Twitter.</p>

<h2 id="parameterizing-3d-printing-for-constellations">Parameterizing 3D Printing for Constellations</h2>
<p>We will be using python to load up our data and create an STL file that will be imported into tinker cad. From tinkercad, we will 3D print the pedestals (what will be used for data visualization). Using the exemplar of constellations, we will see how these pedestals can represent how far each star in the Orion constellation is from Earth using a scaling relation that was embedded in the code. The further the star is (in light years), the taller the pedestal.</p>

<h2 id="fun-with-squishy-circuits">Fun with Squishy Circuits</h2>
<p>Learn how to create a simple circuit through the use of a wonderful combination of play and learning. Squishy Circuits teaches the fundamentals of electrical circuits using conductive and insulating play dough. The Squishy Circuits encourage independent thought and creativity while teaching engineering principles and problem solving.</p>

<h2 id="mobile-solar-marvel">Mobile Solar Marvel</h2>
<p>This workshop is about a creating a mobile device that will store sustainable and clean energy.  We will discuss how to build a model that will be powered by solar energy and connecting it to a  battery compartment where the energy will be stored for later use. Special emphasis will be placed on connecting solar cells to achieve maximum potential energy.</p>

<h2 id="biomimicry-with-lego-spike">Biomimicry with LEGO SPIKE</h2>
<p>We’ll be discussing the use of biomimicry, the design and production of materials and systems modeled off of biological structures and processes, using LEGO SPIKE models. Our task will be to build analogous structures to things we see in nature to test how they function in several tests, including lifting and strength!</p>

<h2 id="arduino-for-visualizing-phenomena-in-the-stem-classroom">Arduino For Visualizing Phenomena in the STEM Classroom</h2>
<p>Arduino offers an opportunity for students to engage in hands-on making and programming. In this workshop, we will explore the Arduino, a programmable circuit board with open source software, and how it can be used to help students visualize STEM phenomena. The workshop will explore an example Arduino project using LED lights, then participants will have a chance to guide their own learning with the option to physically build a circuit with an Arduino circuit board and to work with Arduino code. This workshop is designed for participants of all levels.</p>

<h2 id="makey-makey-coordinates">Makey Makey Coordinates</h2>
<p>I will be focusing on scratch, Makeymakey and Text to Speech and Google Earth. At the workshop, students would look up coordinates of their favorite country/location using Google Earth. Then using a graphite pencil, they would draw the coordinate using a Horizontal and Vertical line. Then they would attach conductive materials like paper clips/metal clips. Then students would work with scratch to develop a code using provided videos as reference. They can then use makeymakey to command the codes and then finally have some interactive coordinate drawing that can say it’s own name out loud with a simple finger tap.</p>
