<p><strong>School based practicum of educational technology 0858-801, Fall 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> educational technology specialist, ed tech practicum, technology coordinator, student teaching, ISTE NETS</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> EDT 801 is a field-based course where students put their developing talents as educational technologists into practice in K-12 schools in the Long Island and New York City region. Students pursuing the New York State Educational Technology Specialist certification <em>must</em> experience placements in elementary (1-6) and segundary (7-12) school settings. Additionally, at least one placement site will be in a school with a diverse student population and one placement will be in a technology-rich school.</p>
<p>Each student will work with a field-based mentor who is a regular employee of a K-12 public school in New York State. Typically field mentors are school or district technology coordinators, school computer or media teachers, principals or assistant principals who have primary responsiblities for technology planning and implementation, or classroom teachers who fill technology leadership roles in their schools. In addition to the field mentor, the course is led by a university faculty supervisor.</p>

<h2>Field-based practicum</h2>
<p>Students will work in 2 different school systems during the course of the semester. Their placements will be sequential; you will not be working in two sites at the same time. Students are expected to spend 10 hours each week working on projects for their sites, including at least 6 hours each week on-site. Typically, these 6 hours are completed once a week during school hours, or twice a week during after-school hours. Students are expected to be on-site for additional horus, as needed, to complete their projects and per requirements by their field supervisor. In most cases practicum students will need to clear 1 or 2 days during the practicum during school hours (typically 8am-3pm) where they can be on their school sites to work with K-12 students. Other times are more flexible and may combine on-site meetings during administrative hours and after school (3pm-6pm) as well as off-site work according to the practicum student’s schedule.</p>
</section>
<section id="university-seminar" class="level2">
<h2>University seminar</h2>
<p>During university seminars students discuss their placements, get help on projects from faculty supervisors and cohort, and demonstrate their progress to their peers. In Fall 2013, the cohort will meet in person every-other-week. During intervening weeks, support and discussion will be carried out through Moodle and other online tools.</p>

<h2>Practicum projects &amp; assessment</h2>
<p>Students will complete 3 major projects in their partner schools during the course of the practicum. The projects will be assessed by their field-based mentor and faculty supervisor through field observations and portfolio assessments. The projects reflect the expectations for practicing Educational Technology Specialists working in New York State public schools and meet the standards outlined by ISTE, the <a href="http://iste.org">International Society for Technology in Education</a>.</p>
<p>Projects do not need to be completed in the order detailed below. The scope of the projects and sequence of their implementation will be developed by the interns in consultation with their school-based mentor and faculty supervisor. Projects will be completed individually or in collaboration with other interns, as appropriate.</p>
<section id="project-1-technology-infrastructure" class="level3">
<h3>Project 1: Technology infrastructure</h3>
<p>For this projects students will work develop a project to help improve the technical infrastructure of the school. Infrastructure improvements may take several different forms. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>facilities improvements: installing new software or operating systems on school computers; installing more wireless access points to improve wifi network</li>
<li>processes: create new procedures for tech support; implement new system for hardware, software, or media management</li>
<li>development: find and apply for grants to improve the school’s use of technology; create budget and implementation plans for future improvements; improve the school or district’s technology plan</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="project-2-professional-development" class="level3">
<h3>Project 2: Professional development</h3>
<p>Working closely with school mentors, interns will conduct a needs assessment of their host school to determine what areas of professional development are most needed and will have the most direct impact on student achievement. They will develop and implement a professional development series informed by current evidence-based practices of “embedded” professional development; models that occur over time and focus on coaching. It’s possible that the <em>professional development</em> and <em>co-teaching</em> projects will be coordinated.</p>

</section>
<section id="project-3-co-teaching" class="level3">
<h3>Project 3: Co-teaching</h3>
<p>For this project interns will be paired with classroom teachers who share their same domain background for teaching. Working with this master teacher, the intern will infuse review an existing unit that makes up part of the school’s curriculum and then find ways to infuse the unit with suitable technologies. The intern will create appropriate, formal or informal, assessment measures to validate that the technology interventions contribute to student achievement. The intern will push-in with the master teacher to teach the technology-enhanced lessons. In most cases this project will take place during regular school hours, but if the situation allows, it can occur in afterschool programs that have academic focuses.</p>

<li>Brief (1-2 page) <strong>narrative</strong> of your experience working with the teachers and administrators in your school placement. Your write-up should also include which of the <a href="http://www.iste.org/standards/standards-for-coaches">NET standards</a> you chose to focus on, and how it was integrated into the work. You should also include a reflection of your participation and what you would have done differently to improve your experience.</li>
<li><strong>Evidence:</strong> These include pictures, screenshots, videos, observation notes, and other artifacts that demonstrate your work and how you aligned to the NET standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The product you turn-in should be organized in a way that would be easy to understand. Be sure to follow academic writing conventions, using proper grammar and spelling. You can combine your portfolio into a single PDF file, upload your narrative and supporting documents here in a single .zip, or share supporting evidence using Google Drive. Your portfolio is not meant to be <em>exhaustive</em> of your work, but <em>selective</em>: a few exemplary documents that demonstrate your best work and support your narrative will suffice.</p>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Assistance for Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you are a qualified student with a disability seeking accommodations under the Americans with Disability Act, you are required to self-identify with the Office of Disability Services, 3rd floor, University Center (516) 877-3145. Please see me at the soonest possible time for special arrangements, seating and other accommodations if necessary. At any point during the semester if you encounter difficulty with the course or feel you could be performing at a higher level, please feel free to see me.</p>

<h3>University Statement on Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>You are expected to behave with the highest level of academic integrity. Cheating and other forms of dishonesty will not be tolerated and will result in the proper disciplinary action from the university. Classroom behavior that interferes with the instructor’s ability to conduct the class or ability of students to benefit from the instruction will not be tolerated. All beepers and cellular phones should be turned off while class is in session. You are expected to come to class prepared - this means having read and studied the assigned chapters before class. By having prepared in this manner, you will be able to maximize your time spent in class.</p>
<p>Adelphi University demands the highest standards of academic integrity. Proper conduct during examinations, the proper attribution of sources in preparation of written work, and complete honesty in all academic endeavors is required. Submission of false data, falsification of grades or records, misconduct during examinations, and plagiarism are among the violations of academic integrity. Students who do not meet these standards are subject to dismissal from the University.</p>


<h3>Use of Candidate Work</h3>
<p>All teacher education programs in New York State undergo periodic reviews by accreditation agencies and the state education department. For these purposes samples of students’ work are made available to those professionals conducting the review. Student anonymity is assured under these circumstances. If you do not wish to have your work made available for these purposes, please let the professor know before the start of the second class. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.</p>
